Introduction 
Linda ran marketing for a midsize online retailer and was thriving: her team had helped drive six straight quarters of growth, and she was praised by sales for her strong partnership and performance. Linda was also a member of the company’s customer council and well respected by the CEO and other managers. 
But she felt stuck in second gear. Her ideas for more innovation were politely listened to in executive meetings, but never seemed to go anywhere—“Yeah, interesting concept, Linda, but way too blue-sky right now.” She raised her hand for bigger jobs in her company, but repeatedly lost out to more experienced outsiders. She wanted to have more impact and occasionally thought about outside opportunities. But when recruiters called, she wasn’t able to picture how she could grab the new job and be successful in it. Linda was frustrated in her quest for a more signifi cant role but had twinges of confusion and insecurity: “Is becoming a leader some mystical transformation? Do I have to be some Sheryl-Sandberg-in-the-making to fulfi ll my professional dreams?” Linda’s business school friends, Sam and Natalie, also ten years into their careers, wrestled with similar questions. Both were also eager for more opportunities for leadership but were struggling with the transition.

Sam, known for quick learning and hard work, had risen from fundraising manager to chief operating offi cer at a growing community nonprofi t. “I’m totally jazzed by the work here and have 100 people reporting to me,” he told Linda proudly. “But I keep waking up at 3 a.m., wondering if I can do this.”
Natalie, a rising tech star in Silicon Valley, was itching to found her own startup. She had good management experience and now also some venture backing and a slate of potential employees eager to join her. But she didn’t want to launch the business only to have investors force her to hand it over to a more seasoned executive. She sensed that running an entire company would be a bigger—and scarier—challenge than anything she’d done so far. 

Linda, Sam, Natalie: this Leader’s Handbook is for you. If you’re hitting a leadership wall like many midcareer professionals, this book will help you break through. It’s also for you if you’re an established manager wanting to take your career to the next level or to increase the scope of your current job, if you want to start your own business, or if you just want to generally reach for more impact in whatever you’re doing. It’s for you whether you’re at a traditional company, startup, nonprofi t, or government organization, or even looking to lead in a more informal or networked enterprise. Breaking through to a higher level of leadership will require you to think differently and may even be an identify shift for you. You’ll have more privileges but also more risk: your daily actions will be much more exposed. But most of all, this shift will require you to do different things. You'be moving from a role where you’re focused on your own learning, collaborating with colleagues, and executing on a direction set by someone else, to a role where success depends more on the direction that you set and mobilizing many other people to get the job done. This book will describe the areas you need to excel and how to build those abilities.

Focus on the fundamentals
Today’s world desperately needs more and better leaders. Intensifying global competition, rising performance expectations, and proliferating social and economic problems everywhere have put an unprecedented premium on leadership. Furthermore, organizations continue to change (as always); they are now less hierarchical, more networked, more nimble, and more technology-enabled than a generation ago.
These changes are driving demand for guidance that has resulted in an explosion of books, articles, and other methods for building leadership skills and knowledge. There are thousands of leadership titles available on Amazon, with many more appearing every year. Much of it is helpful, but there’s also a growing stream of gimmicky quick solutions fl ooding and confusing the market. 
But despite all the change that swirls around us and the cacophony of advice, in its fundamentals, leadership has not changed: it is still about working with other people to achieve common goals. 
Given that reality, we believe the best way for any aspiring leader to succeed and to navigate turbulent times is to tune out the noise and refocus on these fundamentals. By mining the wisdom of the most enduring ideas published in Harvard Business Review, our own expertise, and the experience of some of the world’s top leaders, this book will cut through the noise and provide you with grounding in those fundamentals so you can break through the kinds of barriers that Linda, Sam, and Natalie are facing. 
In doing so, this book will bring you some of the most important research and leadership lessons published in the Harvard Business Review in the last four decades. Much has changed over these years, but many areas of leadership have remained consistent. Many of the same timetested frameworks and ideas apply as much today as they did when they were fi rst published. We describe many of these carefully selected HBR articles in the chapters that follow and list them in a Further Reading section at the end of the book (if you see an HBR article mentioned in the text, you can fi nd more information about it there). 
To shape these concepts into the approach we describe in this book, we’re also drawing on a combined sixty years of our own collective experience working as thought leaders, consultants, or colleagues with leaders of organizations ranging from Fortune 50 corporations, to professional service fi rms, to nonprofi ts and startups worldwide. During that time, we’ve seen hundreds of leaders in action. We’ve also coached them and partnered with them through transformations, crises, and breakthrough achievements. We’ve stood side by side with them as they confronted their own shortcomings, grew, and learned. 
Last, we interviewed nearly forty working senior leaders who graciously shared their perspectives on the core practices and included many of their insights and stories along the way as well. 
Let’s begin with some context—by simply defi ning “leadership.” You can’t develop and get good at something if you don’t understand what it is and why it matters. Once you understand the context, we’ll give you a snapshot of what’s in the book and how it will help you advance as a leader. 

What is leadership?
If you want to become a leader or grow your leadership capability, what does that actually mean? 
The term “leadership” has never had a precise defi nition. For some, it simply means the uppermost segment of an organizational hierarchy. For others, it’s a set of competencies that are totally distinct from those of a manager, at whatever level, akin to how professor Abraham Zaleznik described them in a landmark 1977 HBR article “Managers and Leaders: Are They Different?,” in which he said that managers tame chaos with controls and process, while leaders thrive on ambiguity, creativity, and discovery in order to spur change. For still others, a leader might be a hero whose almost mythical success feels beyond reach, like Steve Jobs or Sheryl Sandberg. And at the opposite extreme, the term “leader” is also often applied to the star on a kids’ soccer team or the more junior manager with a large following on social media. 
We believe that just about everyone has some potential for leadership, and that organizations—and society more broadly—win when more people develop relevant skills and take more initiative to solve problems. 
For this book, though, we define leadership as:
  Achieving signifi cant positive impact—by building an organization of people working together toward a common goal. 

Achieving significant positive impact
“Achieving significant positive impact” means creating results such as a major business transformation, growth at scale, or a new offering that moves markets. The kind of leadership we describe is not just running a big project; it’s about the scale of the results that you achieve when you do. This book will help you achieve that kind of large-scale impact in what you do by encouraging and enabling followers, and creating more value over time than those followers could achieve on their own.
We want you to aim big and understand what achieving it takes. Our chapters are illustrated with examples of successful leaders who have in some way or other really made a difference in their market or competitive arena (for more on these stories, see the box “More on the cases”). For example, one leader we profi le, AIG’s Seraina Macia, tells how, in a previous job, she led a transformation of XL’s North American Property and Casualty business that generated huge returns for the company. Darren Walker, president of the Ford Foundation, explains how he’s been transforming global philanthropy by bringing traditional social justice programs into the digital sphere. Paula Kerger, president of PBS, provides another example of major impact based on dramatically expanding the system’s educational offerings to children and local communities nationwide. (For full disclosure, note that we’ve worked with a number of the leaders we describe in the book in coaching or consulting capacities.) 
Of course, CEOs and presidents are not the only leaders that we cite, and we don’t want to suggest that they are the only role models that you should emulate or the only ones who can create signifi cant positive impact, particularly since it may be a while before you are running an entire organization. However, the steps that these senior executives have taken and the challenges that they have overcome provide lessons for leaders at all levels and in all types of organizations. For example, even if you aren’t at the stage of your career where you’re developing strategy for the entire enterprise, you might need to figure out a strategy for growing a particular product or for a particular initiative. Similarly, while you might not have the responsibility for creating a people capability plan for your whole organization, you will have to build a top-notch team for your area. 
More on the cases
Each of the fi rst fi ve core chapters of this book begins with a true story about how a senior leader made that practice come alive in their organization and how it made a positive difference. You’ll read about the creation of a vision for the World Bank, the development of a strategy for public television, the intentional transformation of people’s capabilities at the Ford Foundation, the step-up in results at XL Insurance, and the drive for innovation at Thomson Reuters.
We’ve chosen these cases and other shorter vignettes throughout the book because they showcase what the practices we describe look like at organizations that might have similar challenges to the ones that you work at today or aspire to run tomorrow. We drew the cases from a diverse set of organizations—for-profit, nonprofit, and public sector—that have long-standing track records rather than the latest headline-grabbing firms. Each one shows the power of leaders using that particular practice to create signifi can't impact in the face of tough business conditions, internal resistance, and their own human limitations and concerns. We use these cases to tease out specific lessons that you can apply to your situation, even if your organization is in a different sector or is a different size, or you are in a less senior position. 

Why “positive” impact?
Emphasizing the word “positive” in our defi ning phrase about leadership impact is not accidental.
We believe the term “leadership” carries with it a responsibility to create not just any impact, but impact that makes a positive difference toward socially or economically responsible goals rather than a bluep printfor effecting some kind of dubious or even evil outcomes. True enough, many of the practices we highlight in this book could be applied to increase performance of criminal or terrorist organizations, too. But we hope you will harness the practices to generally advance people’s welfare, and the fair and open creation of wealth and human capital in market economies. 

Building an organization of people
Leadership is not about making this kind of impact alone; it depends on doing so through others. Leaders must be masters of building and developing collective work, inspiring and organizing others toward a common goal or goals. Since time immemorial, organizations have been the way that people have coordinated and scaled the effectiveness of human talent. And leaders we have worked with over many years have said that building and motivating an organization is the hardest—and most critically important—part of their jobs. 
We use the term “organization” to mean not only traditional corporations like Procter & Gamble or Cisco Systems, but also nonprofi t enterprises, startups, divisions within larger companies, government agencies, or even more loosely coupled groups of people operating as informal communities or virtual networks, such as professional associations, social activist alliances, research collectives, and similar. As long as people can be brought together and motivated to work toward a shared goal, there is an opportunity for a leader (or many leaders collaborating) to create largescale positive impact.
But aligning and motivating that collective effort is deeply challenging. For leaders to succeed, they must address fundamental dilemmas about the human aspects of getting people to work together: differing strengths, attitudes, experiences, ambitions, beliefs, and limitations. And those must be somehow rationalized and aligned with an overall strategy and commitment to achieving collective performance.
For example, Seraina Macia created impact by developing and aligning different groups at XL Insurance, many of whom had confl icting views about how to meet customers’ insurance needs. Darren Walker had to shape a new culture and make some tough people choices to shift the Ford Foundation toward addressing digital justice challenges. Paula Kerger and her team achieved success in transforming children’s television by artfully mobilizing the locally owned and operated network of local public television stations around a new strategic set of service offerings. 
The difference between leaders and managers
We use the terms “managers” and “leaders” in this book, and like Zaleznik, we don’t think they mean the same thing. In our view, what sets leadership apart is the “impact” piece of our defi nition—leaders are able to have greater impact over time than managers.
But that’s not to say that leaders don’t need managerial skills or that they don’t do the work of management. Early in their careers, leaders need to master basic managerial skills and hone them through repeated application. Eventually, however, they add more of the unique leadership capabilities and ways of thinking. People who don’t make the leap will remain managers and continue to contribute. But those who can add leadership abilities to their management repertoire will multiply their value many times over.
As an analogy, consider how great musical conductors have to stay close to—and will often know how to play—the instruments of key soloists in their orchestra. However, they also learn to go beyond their own instrument and bring together the entire ensemble.

While leadership can be defined differently from management, it also emerges out of it, and when done well, it delivers a leap in impact (see fi gure I-1). Leaders achieve their difference—their signifi cant impact—by deeply understanding, continuously learning from, and actually practicing management—and then adding unique leadership actions to the mix.

How to develop as a leader: the six practices 
If you aspire to become a leader, how do you develop the skills and knowledge it takes? The best way is by live practice—doing and learning on the job. Anyone can and should work on these capabilities beginning in the earliest years of his or her career. We’ve seen this in our work: that all of the conceptual frameworks, training programs, personal assessments, experiential exercises, and war stories from others begin to truly sink in only when leaders have to apply them in real time, with real people, and real consequences. Of course, coaching, instruction, and reading can be helpful along the way, but there’s no substitute for wrestling with, and learning from, actual practice.
In our back-to-fundamentals approach, we have identified six essential and timeless practice areas for aspiring leaders, with each of these constituting a chapter of the book. These represent not an encyclopedia of leadership (see the box “What about soft skills?”), but rather the specifi c must-do areas that differentiate those who have the strongest impact:
- Building a unifying vision (chapter 1). Successful leaders use vision to build and motivate an organization and kick-start innovation and aspirational performance. By setting out broad goals and a picture of success, a vision is the critical first step to achieving distinctive impact through people.
- Developing a strategy (chapter 2). After vision, the next step toward major impact is developing a coordinated set of actions so the organization can win—create distinctive value, exceed customer expectations, and beat out market rivals. Leaders do that by challenging their enterprise to answer—and then execute successfully upon—critical questions about where and how to compete.
- Getting great people on board (chapter 3). Nothing matters more to great leaders than people. They recruit, engage, develop, and align the members of an organization with a dual proposition: “if you can give your all to help us thrive collectively, we’ll do our best to help you thrive personally.”
- Focusing on results (chapter 4). Once hired and engaged, the people of an organization must deliver the results that will create impact. Savvy leaders build the processes that enable people working together to focus on and reach continuously higher performance.
- Innovating for the future (chapter 5). Winning strategies and performance results are not guaranteed forever. Leaders have to look at both the present and the future, and build resilience and creativity into their organizations to keep ahead of changes in markets, industry, and business models of competitors.
- Leading yourself (chapter 6). Though the collective effort of an organization is needed to achieve impact, leaders themselves are also part of that organization. The critical role leaders play demands that they also invest in themselves—developing selfunderstanding, ongoing renewal, and enough self-preservation to keep their own performance high.
The first five of these chapters follow a logical sequence: leaders begin with a vision, progressively turn it into action by developing strategy, managing people, and processes, innovating for the longer term, and so forth.
But these practices are by no means necessarily sequential; they are interdependent, often overlapping, and iterative. For example, vision, strategy, and innovation must be closely related, and you must manage people and results at all stages of your work. Moreover, the sixth practice (leading yourself) is foundational to everything else. While it could have been the fi rst chapter in the book, we chose to end with it, as a way to reinforce the need for leaders to continually learn about all of these areas. In addition, we wanted to counter the increasingly common belief that leadership is all about developing inward-facing skills. In our view, leaders need to build their organizations and achieve sustaining results, while simultaneously developing themselves.
Every leader puts their spin on these practices and adjusts them based on their own personalities, proclivities, passions, and situations. But their essence, as captured in the chapters that follow, remains the same. 

Practicing the practices
Repeatedly trying, refl ecting, and then improving how you apply yourself to create impact through the organization is what’s required, and it’s why we call these areas of development “practices.” Successful leaders constantly do these things and work to improve them.
This journey is different for everyone. It might begin, for example, early in your career, when you’re fi rst working as a manager with a more accomplished leader, and joining him or her in doing some of the practices. Over time, you will likely get an opportunity to take charge of some of the practices we describe (creating vision, strategy, etc.). You’ll have varying degrees of success as you take these areas on for the fi rst time—that’s normal. But by reflecting on your successes and failures at every step, you’ll keep making positive adjustments and keep looking for more opportunities to learn.
As you progress, you will reach a level of capability in these six areas that will enable you to achieve increasingly significan't value through the people who work for your team, division, or company. As you succeed, these results will begin to build upon one another—you oversee a new product that becomes a runaway hit, or take charge of a transformational initiative that redefines a major market or puts your company on a new path to growth.
As you reach new levels of competency in each practice, you will experience a magnitude change in performance and more followership in your organization, also accompanied perhaps by a growing personal reputation in your industry. More and more people now want to sign up and work with you. Clients or customers ask for you by name. You’re invited to represent the company at major industry conferences. Whether you use this momentum to take over a new initiative or to start your own company, you’ve begun to truly deliver major impact at scale. You’ve become a leader, capable of rallying an organization of people around a meaningful collective goal and delivering the results to reach it. 

A simple map to help you on your way
For a conceptual map of this book, see fi gure I-2. We treat each practice of leadership distinctly, but as a leader, you’re practicing them all at once. You’re combining them in the ways that are unique to you and your particular organization and context. And as they come together, you will begin to achieve signifi cant positive impact through others—that’s leadership. But it doesn’t end there: to keep moving ahead, you will keep practicing, constantly doing, refl ecting, and learning to make an impact, inspire your organization, and get to the next level.
  So let’s get started!

1. Building a Unifying Vision
A leader’s role is to raise people’s aspirations for what they can become and to release their energies so they will try to get there.
—David Gergen

Exceptional organizations have an exciting, clear, and simple vision—a vision that honors and reinforces the core purpose of the organization, but also creates a picture of where the organization is heading and what it aspires to accomplish in the future. Consider, for example, DuPont’s vision, “to be the world’s most dynamic science company, creating sustainable solutions essential to a better, safer, healthier life for people everywhere”; or Facebook’s, “to give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected.” Divisions and teams within organizations also have visions; for example, Nest, the smart-home division of Alphabet (the parent of what was originally Google), has a vision of creating “the thoughtful home: A home that takes care of the people inside it and the world around it.”
The practice of crafting a vision is a key component of your ability to create signifi cant impact as a leader. Whether you are in charge of the whole organization or just a piece of it, a vision provides the starting point for developing strategic plans, recruiting talent, setting goals, and chal-lenging people to find new and better ways to get things done. Equally important, the vision helps to align groups and individuals (who may be doing quite different work) around a common direction, while also inspiring them to contribute to something that is bigger than them.
Your role as a leader is to shape a compelling vision to fi t your organi-zation (or unit, or team) and its environment, and then recraft it periodi-cally as conditions change. By crafting, sharpening, or revising your vision in the right way, at the right time, you can have enormous influence over your organization’s or unit’s direction and the emotional engagement of your people. But this kind of vision doesn’t just drop out of the sky. The practice of making a vision is challenging because:
- It can be hard to determine whether it’s the right time to develop a new vision; you don’t want to do it too often and risk burnout, you don’t want to do it too often and risk burnout, or not often enough and risk complacency.
- It's easy to be too timid in setting a vision; to do its job, a vision must be bold
- Many of your colleagues and constituents will have competing ideas and points of view and you’ll need to corral these into a coherent direction.
- The process can be time-consuming, so you’ll have to carve out time to focus on creating the vision while dealing with shorter-term issues that will seem more urgent and compelling.
- Assuming you are not the CEO, you’ll need to connect the vision for your specifi c team or business unit to your company’s overall vision, without losing the overall energy and meaning of the broader vision. Sometimes this is just a smaller version of the cor-porate vision, but it can be supportive while somewhat different.
Tackling these challenges head-on is a critical part of stepping up from management to leadership. And although it doesn’t have to be the fi rst thing you do, you will have to focus on building a unifying vision period-ically, because it provides the foundation for many of the other practices that will make you a great leader. If you practice it on a relatively small scale with your team or your department, it will give you more confidence to build a broader vision at another point in your career.
As part of this practice, leaders need to first understand what a good vision is; they then need to lead a process for determining the vision for their organization or unit. To give you a sense of what this means, let’s look at how Jim Wolfensohn shaped a new vision for the World Bank as a whole and how other leaders in the Bank then built exciting visions for their own teams as a result.

Creating a vision for the World Bank
When Wolfensohn became president of the World Bank in 1995, he inherited a venerable institution under siege. The organization had been successful in supporting worldwide economic development after World War II and promoting democratic social and economic systems during the Cold War. But with the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, suddenly the West had won and the quasi-political purpose of the World Bank no longer made sense. Additionally, the opening of world fi nancial markets and the rise of China and other Asian economies meant that developing countries had access to capital from sources other than the World Bank. Meanwhile, the Bank was being criticized for earlier neglect of such concerns as the environment, local culture, corruption, social justice, and others. By the time Wolfensohn took the helm, these forces had coalesced into a public move-ment, called “fifty years is enough,” that explicitly questioned the World Bank’s need to exist.
These attacks caused internal morale to plummet. In addition, an in-ternal Bank study had just concluded that one-third of the Bank’s projects were not producing the desired economic results.
Given this crisis of confi dence, Wolfensohn realized that he needed to reestablish a compelling vision that would support the continuation of the Bank and reenergize the staff. “Reconstruction” and “strengthening the Western Bloc” were no longer relevant, and the core purpose of broad “ economic development,” while still important, was too vague to resonate with staff at a personal level or the outside world. Something else was needed.
Based on active discussions and debates with his senior staff, Wolfen-sohn decided that the answer was to refocus the Bank on poverty reduction, an area that an earlier president, Robert McNamara, had fi rst emphasized, but that had become overshadowed by years of debt crises, structural readjustments, and other development issues. After all, in 1996 poverty was endemic, with more than 28 percent of the world’s population living in extreme poverty (less than $1.90 per day, according to the World Bank’s data). Remedying that dismal reality was an urgent need.
Wolfensohn realized that he couldn’t simply cook up a vision for the Bank with his senior team and then drop it on everyone. Instead, there had to be a process of dialogue with stakeholders—listening and testing in a way that would make them feel that the vision was something that they had helped create. To do this, he asked Caroline Anstey, his head of com-munications, to draft an initial vision statement that would capture his intent to focus the Bank on poverty reduction and then to engage multiple stakeholders in fl eshing it out. The team used the initial draft to solicit input from clients, government offi cials, board members, and senior man-agers. It held focus groups with staff and built group discussions into vari-ous meetings, off-sites, and leadership events. Wolfensohn himself actively participated in many of the sessions and regularly reviewed the emerging vision with Anstey and others.
The result was a phrase that was eventually chiseled in stone on the walls of the Bank’s headquarters building in Washington, DC: “Our dream is a world free of poverty.”
The stakeholder discussions also generated many other messages about the organization’s aspirations, so that the overall vision eventually looked like this:
Our dream is a world free of poverty.
- To fi ght poverty with passion and professionalism for lasting results
- To help people help themselves and their environment by providing resources, sharing knowledge, building capacity, and forging partnerships in the public and private sectors
- To be an excellent institution able to attract, excite and nurture diverse and committed staff with exceptional skills who know how to listen and learn
Over time, with regular repetition and use, this statement and the aspiration it described became an antidote to the external criticism that called for the end of the Bank. It also helped leaders in the organization to focus and prioritize the Bank’s strategic goals, both at the corporate level and throughout the regions, countries, and technical networks in which it operated. Indeed, the focus on poverty alleviation eventually became an ongoing measure of progress, not only for the Bank, but also for other de-velopment institutions such as the United Nations. The vision also resonated with the staff at a personal level since many Bank staff either came from poor countries or frequently traveled to areas that were economically disadvantaged.
The power of the World Bank’s vision was not just a matter of framing strategy and building engagement, however. It also was unifying, allow-ing the Bank to leverage the contributions of its individual employees at scale. The Bank, like most organizations, consists of people with a wide variety of skills and backgrounds across many functions. There are econ-omists, agronomists, water experts, civil engineers, accountants, cleri-cal personnel, writers, administrative assistants, and many more, all in  different silos, departments, and locations. But because the organization’s “world free of poverty” vision was so powerful, these individuals with their unique contributions could feel as if they were joining forces to achieve that larger inspirational goal together. They weren’t just writing reports, doing studies, or making loans, but were part of an institution and a team that were striving to make life better for millions of people.

They weren’t just writing reports, doing studies, or making loans, but were part of an institution and a team that were striving to make life better for millions of people.
This vision also cascaded through the organization. Leaders of regional divisions and functional areas throughout the World Bank developed vi-sions that catalyzed their people around particular challenges relating to poverty elimination. For example, Mieko Nishimizu, the vice president of the South Asia region, focused on a vision for reducing poverty at the village level in her countries, particularly since many of the previous economic development projects had not reached the villages. Dennis Whittle, another senior leader who headed up a strategy team, developed a vision of leveraging ideas worldwide to fi ght poverty rather than just relying on the Bank’s expertise. This led his team to create a global “development mar-ketplace” for poverty-reduction solutions that eventually became a regular part of the Bank’s strategic approach.
What is a vision? 
Before we describe how you as a leader create a vision for your department, team, or unit, we need to explain what a vision really is—and what features make it work in all the ways that the poverty-elimination vision Wolfen-sohn helped engender worked for the World Bank.
“Vision” often means different things to different people; in organiza-tions, it’s often confused with “mission,” “values,” and more. These concepts overlap somewhat, but we believe that vision gives you a unique opportu-nity to exert your leadership. It is the one pillar that you, as a leader, can periodically reassess and reshape, as Wolfensohn did at the World Bank. Nobody else can do this for you; it’s your role to catalyze and steer both the process of determining a vision and also the particular boldness of your approach.
So how is a vision different from a mission or a company’s values? An organization’s mission is its long-term, mostly unchanging charter—its unique reason for existence. For the World Bank, the mission is to provide fi nancial and technical support for economic development in disadvan-taged parts of the world. A network of hospitals might have the mission of “providing a full range of health-care services to a target market,” or a manufacturing concern in business might be “to develop, produce, sell, and service certain products for small and medium-sized enterprises.” These kinds of statements defi ne the business they are in and can be accessed in their legal articles of incorporation, founder’s early statements, or discus-sions with board members and senior leaders.
Values too are enduring, though they may respond a bit to the times. These are the ground rules for how the enterprise and its people should work to get things done. Values tend to be more personal; they are the ideal operating guidelines for personal behavior that individuals are supposed to follow as they do their work. At the World Bank, for example, a code of  conduct called “living the values” outlines specifi c ways that staff should interact with colleagues, clients, civil society, and local communities, and how managers should ideally behave toward their people.
A vision, on the other hand, is a picture or snapshot of what the or-ganization or your unit wants to accomplish over the next several years or where its efforts are pointing it in the long term. The vision conveys a direction—not how to get there (that’s strategy), nor the immediate mea-surable goals that drive performance, but a context within which specific strategies and goals can be framed. For the World Bank, the shift to freeing the world from poverty represented a material change from the organiza-tion’s previous direction of facilitating post–World War II reconstruction and supporting Cold War–era democratic capitalism. And at the unit level, Dennis Whittle’s vision to leverage ideas from around the world that could reduce poverty was a dramatic change from the strategy team’s previous reliance on its own experts. (Table 1-1 shows how vision is different from mission and values.)
To be sure, different leaders approach the term “vision” differently. See the box “The elements of a vision” for another classic defi nition of how these ideas fi t together and what makes an effective vision.

The elements of a vision
In their classic HBR article “Building Your Company’s Vision,” Jim Collins and Jerry Porras suggest that your enduring mission and your aspiration are the two elements that meld together to form your vision. Based on their research about organizations that are “built to last,” they say,
  A well-conceived vision consists of two major components: core ideology and envisioned future . . . Core ideology, the yin in our scheme, defi nes what we stand for and why we exist. Yin is unchanging and complements yang, the envisioned future. The envisioned future is what we aspire to become, to achieve, to create—something that will require signifi cant change and progress to attain.
Putting these two elements together, they explain, requires that you “understand the difference between what should never change and what should be open for change, between what is genuinely sacred and what is not.”
At the World Bank, for example, supporting economic development through loans and technical advice is the unchanging yin that says why the institution exists, while “a world free of poverty” is the yang, the envisioned future.


What makes a vision compelling? 
It’s not enough just to set a direction. A vision has to have certain charac-teristics to be an effective motivator and strategic unifier.
A good vision is aspirational, almost dreamlike, simple, and compel-ling. It’s the kind of statement that should make you want to be part of the organization, to join in the pursuit of that vision. It has emotional reso-nance. The vision also must be clear: if it’s confusing or vague, nobody will follow it. Finally, it must be bold: you must push your organization to look to the future, see around corners, and point toward something audaciously far in front of it.
See the box “Criteria for organizational vision” for a checklist of these criteria to use as you work on your vision.

The World Bank’s vision of “a world free of poverty” has all of those char acteristics. It’s simple, compelling, and highly aspirational, and it al-lows the Bank’s leaders to set strategic goals, subgoals, and priorities for  projects, regions, countries, and the institution as a whole. See the box “Other vision examples” for more visions at both organizational and unit levels.

But not every leader has the opportunity to create a vision as far-reaching as those of these large corporations. The vision you create for your unit, however, should still be powerful for you and your team and should make all of you feel that what you are doing is more than just a job. So no matter what kind of organization you are a part of, think about how your team or unit can have a transformative (or extremely positive) impact on your internal or external customers. (See table 1-3 for some examples.)

Boldness
Vision isn’t about just doing incrementally more than what you do now. Rather it’s about defi ning a direction that is signifi cantly different to cre-ate new value for the organization and its constituents—not tomorrow but over many years. As Dominic Barton, the global managing partner of Mc-Kinsey, told us, “Managers take care of the railroad tracks that are already there and make sure that the trains run well. But leaders shift the tracks, they ponder different futures, they swing for the fences.”
This boldness is important because it is what inspires, what serves as a North Star for people throughout your organization. Jim Collins and Jerry Porras describe what they call BHAGs, or “big, hairy, audacious goals”: 
  All companies have goals. But there is a difference between merely having a goal and becoming committed to a huge, daunting chal-lenge—such as climbing Mount Everest. A true BHAG is clear and compelling, serves as a unifying focal point of effort, and acts as a catalyst for team spirit. It has a clear fi nish line, so the organiza-tion can know when it has achieved the goal; people like to shoot for fi nish lines. A BHAG engages people—it reaches out and grabs them. It is tangible, energizing, highly focused. People get it right away; it takes little or no explanation.
Consider the vision of the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas. Its vision is “to make cancer history,” which has the double meaning of developing breakthrough science (historical new discoveries) and eradi-cating cancer altogether. It resonates with researchers, clinicians, and an-cillary workers, as well as donors, patients, and family members. It’s also memorable and vivid—and certainly bold. Its boldness has spawned more than a dozen specifi c moon-shot programs in different clinical depart-ments to make signifi cant advances in reducing mortality and suffering on specifi c types of cancers in defi ned periods of time.
Of course, your team may not have a vision at the scale of eradicating cancer or eliminating global poverty, but to be effective, a vision must still be signifi cant relative to the day-to-day work of the team. At AIG, for in-stance, Seraina Macia currently runs a unit called Blackboard Insurance that is seeking to improve commercial underwriting by developing artifi -cial intelligence and data analytics to reshape the whole process and, by extent, the industry itself. Similarly, the human resource team of a large corporation that we know formulated its vision around making the com-pany one of the top fi ve places to work in the United States and a preferred destination for graduates of engineering schools.
For the most compelling visions, going bold doesn’t mean fi nancial success, but rather striving for an exciting contribution to customers or to society. In the HBR article “Successful Startups Don’t Make Money Their Primary Mission,” describing successful new ventures, Kevin Laws, COO of AngelList, argues that if the goal of an organization is simply to make money, it won’t make it through the rough patches. Sure, it needs to make money in order to achieve its vision, but without that separate vision to guide and inspire the people involved, the organization won’t do either. Ex-amples of this abound: Google didn’t set out to become a company with one of the largest market capitalizations in the world, but rather to “organize the world’s information and make it accessible to everyone.” Apple didn’t start out with the vision of having an astronomic stock price, but rather, in Steve Jobs’s original formulation, to “make a contribution to the world by making tools for the mind that advance humankind.”
The vision cascade
Note that visions and associated BHAGs are not the sole province of the CEO and the corporate level. Like Macia, if you are the leader of a unit, division, or even a team, you can develop your own bold vision. But for that kind of vision, there is an additional criterion: it must support and align with the organization’s overall vision.
For example, Macia’s Blackboard unit at AIG is focused on underwriting, but it aligns with and supports the overall vision of the company to leverage technology and data science in the reinvention of insurance. Similarly, the MD Anderson moon-shot programs are essentially visions created by clinical division heads, but they all support the overall vision of “making cancer history.”
Whether you are creating a vision for your whole organization or re-crafting a vision for your particular unit, keep these defi nitions and re-quirements in mind. They’ll help you refi ne and improve your vision—and help your team do the same—throughout the process.

Crafting your vision
You can break the practice of actually crafting a vision to meet these stan-dards into four sequential steps. The fi rst is to determine whether it’s even the right time to create or revise your organization’s or team’s vision. The second is to establish your own draft vision as a starting point. The next step is to engage your own team and other stakeholders in actually craft-ing a more refined vision together. Finally, you’ll need to help your people connect their work to the vision so that they understand how their contri-bution makes a difference.
Step 1. Determine whether the time is right
Whether you are a CEO or the leader of a department, function, or plant, you need to periodically ask yourself whether you have the right vision for your organization and whether it’s time to modify it or work on a new one. That’s all the more necessary if you’re just coming into a new leadership role.
But, often, particularly for new leaders, there is so much going on and so much to do, it’s easy to get caught up in the day-to-day activities and forget or put off setting direction.
Even long-serving executives can become too passive; having been in the same organization for a while often makes leaders blind to their chang-ing environment—at least until some crisis shakes their world and sinks their numbers. But staying attuned to the ways the world is changing is critical for a leader. It is your opportunity—and your role as a leader—to identify when to reshape a vision.
When to develop a new vision
It may be obvious that you need to sharpen or reshape your vision com-pletely because of a changing environment or new organizational opportu-nities, as was the case with the World Bank. Or it may simply be clear that the current path isn’t working.
But the need for a new vision may not be immediately obvious. For example, when Patrick O’Sullivan became the CEO of Eagle Star Insur-ance in the United Kingdom, the company’s senior leaders told him that the company was doing fi ne and that its vision to provide reliable, low-cost property and casualty insurance was suffi cient. When O’Sullivan dug into the numbers, however, he realized that the current business model wasn’t working and that Eagle Star was surviving only because it was understating its reserves and was covered from market pressures by its parent company, British American Tobacco. As a result, O’Sullivan spent his fi rst few months meeting with his direct reports, other managers, and groups of employees to help them appreciate the so-called burning plat-form. As  people began to realize the gravity of the business situation, he was able to discuss with them a fresh vision for the company around the concept of “winning through customer service.” Eventually, this led to a major turnaround of Eagle Star and its subsequent sale to Zurich Financial Services.
For example, Intuit spent twenty years achieving the vision of chang-ing the way people managed their personal fi nances and, in the process, became a software powerhouse, with Quicken as its fl agship product. Once it got to the summit, however, other companies started to copy its success, moving into the market and fi nding new ways of attracting customers. When Brad Smith became CEO in 2008, he recognized that the company had become so focused on adding incremental features to improve stability that it had no big aspiration for the future. So he worked with his team to develop a new vision of becoming “one of the most design-driven compa-nies in the world,” moving the organization toward thinking about delight-ing customers. This new vision led Intuit to design products differently, incorporate new skills, sell off legacy products (including Quicken), and rethink many of its ways of working.
Finding the capacity to do this isn’t easy, particularly since most lead-ers already are starved for time. Carving out additional time to devote to vision is hard and can easily be put off until later. So set aside a particular time each year to refl ect on your vision and think about whether it still fulfills its purpose. For example, Gary Wendt, the former CEO of GE Capital, used to ask all his business leaders to conduct “dreaming sessions” with their teams each year in advance of the strategic planning process. Each team had the opportunity (and the luxury) of stepping back and dreaming about where the business could be in a few years and how it could be sig-nifi cantly different and better, which would then force the team to assess whether the current vision would get it there.
When to stay the course
Don’t be too fast to reset your organization’s path. Many visions will last for years and don’t need to be changed signifi cantly. The amount of time and work it takes to create a vision is signifi cant—and can actually be destruc-tive if you are pivoting too quickly—so it might be that all you need to do is make sure that everyone understands it.
If you do want to retain the existing vision, at least for now, convey your decision to your team and the organization. Often, new leaders feel that they have to make a big splash and reshape their unit’s or company’s vision right away, or others may expect them to do so. But since the vision is an aspiration that requires years to achieve, it is perfectly legitimate to say that it’s still the right direction but “we’re not there yet.” Then you can focus your energy—and everyone else’s—on what’s needed to keep moving forward, pick up the pace, or go about achieving the vision in some new ways. The key is to be explicit about your decision and not leave people guessing or wondering when the big announcement will come.
Finally, even if you and your team are convinced that you need new vision, that might not be the fi rst thing you do as a new leader. Some-times there are more urgent issues to tackle, particularly relating to the survival or stabilization of the fi rm. Louis Gerstner, the former CEO of IBM who took over the company in the early 1990s when it was experiencing a major financial crisis, is famously misquoted for saying, “The last thing IBM needs is a vision.” This was considered a startling comment from a prominent senior leader who had previously been a consultant at Mc Kinsey and was famous for his visionary and strategic acumen. What he really said was that “the last thing IBM needs right now is a vision.” Gerstner helped IBM refashion its vision as a hardware provider to a pro-vider of integrated solutions. But he started that process in his second year after fi rst dealing with cash flow problems, getting the right leadership team, and redesigning the structure of the company at the beginning of his tenure.
How to gauge whether you need a new vision
To understand whether your organization needs a new vision, fi rst assess the current vision. Is there one? Does it meet the criteria laid out for a good vision earlier in this chapter? (See table 1-4, “Is it time to create or refi ne your company’s vision?” for more questions to ask.)
If you are interviewing for a new leadership role, you should ask each person you talk with to describe the vision, not just for the company, but also for the unit that you might be leading. That’s a quick way for you to learn whether one really exists or whether you need to change it. In some cases, it will be obvious, because of either performance shortfalls or a cri-sis—and that may be why you are being hired. In other cases, however, you may see the need for a new vision, but others may not.
Even if you’re not new to your organization or position, you should pe-riodically test whether everyone truly understands the vision by talking to a random sample of people in your organization or department—say, fi fteen to twenty. Ask each to quickly share their view of where they think the organization is heading over the next few years and how they feel about it. If you get many different answers or the answers aren’t convincing, then perhaps it’s time to get to work on a new or refreshed vision. You should also periodically ask yourself and your team whether there have been significant changes in the business environment, technology, or competition that should trigger a rethinking of the vision.

Step 2. Develop your starting-point vision
Once you determine that it is time for a new or revised vision, you need to put together a draft starting point to set the process in motion and to con-vey your perspective on what to include. This doesn’t mean that you need to be the sole visionary for your company or your part of it, but at the same time, you can’t be absent from the process and just give your vision team a blank sheet of paper.Based on extensive surveys of thousands of working people in organizations, professors James Kouzes and Barry Posner, in their HBR article “To Lead, Create a Shared Vision” have found that the ability to be forward looking is the second-highest characteristic of what employees look for in a leader (trailing only behind honesty). In other words, your followers—the people you lead—are expecting you to envision, anticipate, and set a direc-tion for the future. Depending on where you are in the organization, this can mean different things. At lower levels, it could center around articulating a new way of getting projects done faster and with greater impact, or signifi cantly ratcheting up service to customers; at higher levels, it might involve setting direction for how your unit will make a difference in the next few years; and at the CEO level, the challenge will be to fi gure out an exciting enterprise path for the next decade.
To do this, Kouzes and Posner strongly suggest that you start by talk-ing to and listening to your own people, both direct reports and other fol-lowers. Find out their ideas, dreams, thoughts, hopes, and concerns about the future for your team, unit, or organization. Tap into their aspirations and fi nd out what would be exciting for them so that the vision you eventually create will resonate with the people who have to make it happen. See the box “A vision-creating exercise” for one way to do this.
Of course, you can’t stop there. You also need to incorporate your own thoughts and dreams. Some of the vision should be based on good common business acumen and insight. Scan the horizon. What’s happening in your industry or your sector? Are there unmet customer, market, or societal needs that your organization or unit has the capability to fulfi ll? Are there new technologies that you could leverage? How could you differentiate your organization from your competitors (or even from other units in the company)? More personally, what’s the impact that you’d like to have over the next few years or more? What would make you feel like you’ve really made a difference?
As you go through this thought process, start putting together options, choices, and what-if statements. For example, when Jim Wolfensohn was first thinking about the vision for the World Bank, he considered the pos-sibility of focusing on measures of global economic development or aiming for a certain number of countries to achieve a target level of financial health. Eventually he settled fi rmly on the elimination of poverty. This was partly because of what he had heard during his trips to villages and neigh-borhoods in developing countries about unmet needs and decades of gov-ernment inaction. But the decision also came from his own deep-seated conviction that the world could be a better place and the value that he put on improving individual lives. In other words, his starting point was not only intellectual, but was also shaped by his personal values.
A vision-creating exercise
One way to tap into your team members’ ideas about vision is to ask them to reinvent their offi cial job titles so that they refl ect the kind of value that they want to create and the impact that they aspire to have on custom-ers. Professor Dan Cable from the London Business School, in his HBR article “Creative Job Titles Can Energize Workers,” describes how job titles improve employee satisfaction and engagement by giving people a better sense of how their work creates value and impacts customers. Disney is a prime example of this approach—calling theme park employ-ees “cast members” and engineers “imagineers.” These titles are consis-tent with the company’s overall vision, which is “to make people happy.”
Lior Arussy, founder and CEO of the customer experience fi rm Stra-tivity, uses this approach to help teams get excited about what they can potentially accomplish together, which is the essence of a team’s vision. For example, members of a sales team came up with titles such as “director of customer fi rst impressions,” “customer dreams fulfi llment manager,” and “red carpet roller.” All these indicate how the team wants to make customers feel special in their interactions with the company, which is a great basis for a team vision. (For more, see Arussy’s book Next Is Now: 5 Steps for Embracing Change―Building a Business That Thrives into the Future.) 
As you think about creating a first draft vision for your organization or unit, think about how you can respond to the business issues but also be true to yourself. Consider, for example:
- What values and beliefs do you hold broadly and also specifi c to the mission of your organization or the work of your unit?
- How will your leadership values and beliefs actually shape the or-ganization or your unit for the better?
Once you settle on a focus or theme for your draft vision, also consider how to be bold, audacious, and inspirational. Don’t settle for a vision that you know you can achieve, but rather something that will require creative thought, discovery, and experimentation. Remember that your purpose here is to inspire and energize, not to tell people what to do.
At the same time, don’t put the entire burden on yourself. As Kouzes and Posner point out, your job is not to be an emissary from the future with all the answers about what’s next for your organization. Rather your job is to start the conversation, point the way, and ask provocative questions that can help everyone get excited and inspired about the future.
Step 3. Engage stakeholders
Once you come up with your own draft ideas, you need to engage others in developing and fl eshing them out. Involving others with different perspec-tives ensures that you create the best vision possible and also jump-starts buy-in throughout the organization. For example, at the World Bank, Wolfensohn and his senior leaders actively engaged different stakeholders in providing input and iteratively co-creating the vision based on his initial commitment to poverty eradication. By involving others, he created a vision that tapped into everyone’s passions, while also giving many people a voice in the process.
Every organization is different and every situation has its own unique characteristics and cast of characters, but to engage stakeholders, you fi rst need to identify who to involve and then decide what the process of engagement will look like.
Who should you involve?

2. Developing a Strategy

The essence of strategy is making choices . . . One of the leader’s jobs is to teach others in the organization about strategy—and also to say no.
—Michael Porter

In chapter 1, we introduced “vision”—the practice of creating a unifying picture of success for the future. To realize a vision, you need a strategy—a coordinated set of concrete actions to reach the vision and achieve impact in the market. Welcome to our second leadership practice.
Many strategy discussions are faddish (e.g., one-size-fits-all solutions for greatness) or misleading (e.g., in the fast-moving global economy, strat-egy is dead). But strategy always depends on a company’s particular situa-tion, and though it has evolved far beyond corporate planning, the concept is hardly dead.
Developing strategic thinking and learning to assess the trade-offs of different strategic choices will help you grow as a leader. Several executives 46HBR Leader’s Handbookthat we interviewed highlighted how successful strategies boosted both the impact of the organization and their own leadership, too: CEO David Winn’s breakthrough retail strategy for American Express France in the 1990s earned him a subsequent stream of top job career opportunities; General Stanley McChrystal was celebrated for the daring network strat-egy that dramatically degraded Al Qaeda during the Iraq War; Anne  Mulcahy became one of the most infl uential CEOs of her day for her strat-egy that rescued Xerox from bankruptcy.
But strategy is not just for CEOs. Most organizations have an overall corporate strategy that is supported by smaller, more focused strategies for specifi c business units to roll out individual products or services or to guide specifi c initiatives. Strategy making at any level offers rich opportunities for you to hone your leadership skills—by analyzing your unit’s situation, under-standing different choices for operating within your market, and building commitment among other people for a particular course of action. Throughout the process, you also can learn why, when, and how to stick to those decisions—saying no to initiatives that take your intended strategy off track.
We’ll show you the enduring fundamentals of this practice and then walk you through six steps of strategy making—from defi ning a process, to making decisions and implementing them—so that you can increase your own leadership impact.
We’ll begin with a recent case of a strategy-making process within a relatively large organization: how a small team of unit leaders at the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) developed, through cycles of adaptive learning, a strategy for a new 24/7 children’s educational TV channel. The strategy—which resulted in one of the most successful service launches in recent PBS history—began as a bottom-up initiative and had to overcome the initial doubts of PBS’s CEO.
A strategy for a dedicated children’s channel at PBS 
Children’s programming has long been part of PBS’s cultural and educa-tional mission. But beloved shows such as Sesame Street and Daniel Tiger’s Neighborhood have historically had to compete for airtime with all the other programming that local member stations distribute, so the hours of children’s educational broadcasting are always limited.
In 2005 PBS made a strategic move to reach more children beyond its member stations’ segmented schedules: it joined a consortium of partners to launch an additional nationwide channel dedicated solely to kids’ programming (at launch, the channel was called PBS Kids Sprout) that would be distributed, through cable and satellite, throughout the day and evening. The channel was initially successful, but in 2013, because of some of the partners’ shifting priorities and other educational concerns, PBS (under the direction of CEO Paula Kerger) chose to withdraw from the partnership.
Following the withdrawal, Lesli Rotenberg, PBS’s senior vice presi-dent and general manager of children’s media and education, continued to see an opportunity for PBS to expand its educational service to children. As she talked to local station managers and looked at Nielsen ratings and other data such as Google Analytics to better understand children’s view-ing patterns, she saw that there was a continuing need for more quality children’s programming, especially during weekday evenings and through-out all hours of the weekend. She also believed if PBS now built its own kids’ service, separate from its onetime partners, it not only would expand overall preschool audiences, but could help realize a vision Kerger had been emphasizing—reaching more children in TV households that couldn’t afford cable channels or access to broadband internet. Rotenberg pitched Kerger on building a new, all-PBS children’s channel.
Her boss was skeptical at first. “I didn’t think there was a big enough market for us alone, nor that local stations had spectrum available for a dedicated channel,” Kerger recalled. “I told Lesli she’d have to convince me with some real numbers, and a viable new strategy.”
As Rotenberg gathered data and built a business case, Kerger met with her periodically to review her fi ndings, always remaining tough on her gen-eral manager. From the start, Kerger insisted that the new strategy answer three questions: Is there a market need and opportunity for PBS to do this alone? Are local stations willing and able to deliver it? Can PBS organiza-tionally develop and sustain it at current investment levels?
“This concept has to be both market-driven and sustainable. We can’t fritter away resources on a one-shot idea,” Kerger told Rotenberg. But upon refl ection, the PBS CEO began to see some broader potential: “Media land-scapes were changing because of digital—and this was particularly true for children’s media. I urged Lesli to team up with Ira Rubenstein, head of our digital group, and to collaborate on shaping a strategy.”
Working together, Rotenberg and Rubenstein began to see the ben-efi ts of choosing a more multiplatform approach. Their excitement grew as team members brainstormed ways to integrate educational games with television programming, based on research that proved children’s learning accelerates when they play games and video connected to the same curric-ulum goals. They started to pull in other PBS functions, too (technology, member relations, etc.), including Renard Jenkins of engineering, to expand their innovative thinking and to make the operational details more concrete.
As this expanded team marshaled more specifi cs for a new children’s channel, Kerger became its coach. The CEO kept the pressure on, but also reinforced the team’s collaborative problem-solving approach, help-ing members learn from each other’s expertise. In this way, they tackled technical problems like extending the reach of regular broadcast program-ming, while also developing pedagogical ideas at the intersection of digital and broadcast. They also brainstormed different ways to minimize costs. When Kerger set a goal for the number of PBS stations that had to commit to the new service for it to be sustainable, the strategy team began to regularly engage local leaders. Those discussions helped the team shape the outlines of the new programming service, while also assessing implications for building and maintaining the channel.
Through research and ongoing discussions with member stations, the strategy team members developed options for answering Kerger’s initial questions. They then worked to narrow those down to their fi nal answers, which resulted in the following:
- There was indeed a quantifi able market opportunity in communi-ties for a new 24/7 PBS KIDS channel offering the organization’s historically high-quality programming, especially with the deci-sion to target higher engagement among children, including more lower-income households (via broadcast) and a growing population attracted to online streaming (via digital).
- There were also opportunities to expand PBS’s reach to certain community institutions (such as hospitals, where children were up at odd hours watching television).
- Member stations had spectrum available that they would use to broadcast this programming around the clock to their communi-ties, and a signifi cant number were prepared to make a commit-ment to do so.
- A new 24/7 children’s service could be fi nancially viable if it could build on existing shows and add digital features incrementally, and if PBS units outside the kids’ team would prioritize this project over other initiatives. With this approach, existing budgets could therefore support the service, as operating units shared both new development and ongoing operational tasks by working together more closely.
These recommendations represented some tough choices for PBS and the team. The success of the initiative would depend on the participation of a suffi cient number of member stations and on PBS’s willingness to  redirect people resources. It would also require PBS to commit to a project that would have a permanent impact on the organization’s operating budget.
The team’s can-do approach, however, encouraged cost-saving col-laboration and helped smooth over what might have otherwise been turf battles. Instead of competing for budgets, the members shared resources to reduce duplication of effort and hiring. The children’s unit cut back de-velopment of brand-new content, instead relying on existing educational programming. The digital team focused its efforts on bringing the channel online via a livestream feed. And engineering prioritized its technical work to accommodate the new service. Kerger explained some of the choices they made as part of the strategy process: “We traded off developing some near-term new programming to build a stronger, longer-term growth plat-form through which even more programming will be delivered in coming years.”
Once Kerger embraced the team’s strategy proposal, she began to ad-vocate for the service across the network. In the latter half of 2016, when enough member stations signaled their formal interest and commitments on both sides were agreed, the CEO green-lighted the project for launch. The PBS KIDS 24/7 channel (as it was now branded) was formally rolled out in January 2017.
The CEO and the strategy team, working together and with member stations, had created a unique offering: the only 24/7 nationally distrib-uted channel of engaging, curriculum-based, noncommercial educational programming, available for free, enhanced with links to educational dig-ital games, available on children’s digital devices at home or for viewing wherever they might be. Engaging, multiplatform, interactive, and ped-agogically rigorous, PBS KIDS 24/7 was like nothing else in the market. And it was successful: a large majority of the stations committed to PBS KIDS 24/7 in the fi rst year, making it available to 95 percent of all US TV households. It was a big step forward in recognizing Kerger’s vision and the mission of the organization: PBS ratings among kids increased by 23 percent—including growth of 85 percent among children in low-income families.
Kerger views the strategy for the offering’s development and launch as one of the more successful in her tenure at the network. She is quick to give credit to Lesli Rotenberg and the full team that created it together. (Kerger today recalls her pride and wonder at seeing how many different contributors to the effort were in the room at the party celebrating the channel launch.) PBS KIDS 24/7 went on to become a valuable piece of the broader PBS corporate strategy in place at the time, focused on develop-ing quality noncommercial content and strong distribution, strengthening the health of the PBS member station network, and building a culture of innovation.
What is a strategy?
We define strategy as a coordinated set of actions that organizations, divisions, and teams follow to win: to create distinctive value for customers, differentiate their performance, beat out competitors, and move toward the vision they’ve set. Leaders develop a strategy by guiding their people through choices about where and how to compete for customers that are better than their rivals’. (Our perspective here is indebted to seminal works by Peter Drucker, A. G. Lafl ey, Roger Martin, and Michael Porter.)
Following a coordinated set of intentional actions is a reminder that strategy is not accidental. Though companies and initiatives occasionally thrive by being in the right place at the right time, enduring business suc-cess requires that the group’s actions be deliberate. PBS KIDS 24/7 didn’t simply fall into its new strategy; it was coordinated by Rotenberg and the full team under Kerger’s leadership.
The phrase “where and how to compete” points to the kinds of options and decisions you’ll sift through to develop strategic choices for your unit or initiative. In creating products, services, or other business programs, you’ll have to decide about particular arenas to focus on (e.g., customers in a cer-tain geography, industry, or market space) and the way you’ll serve your chosen customers (e.g., by offering some combination of benefits, pricing, branding, additional support, etc.). For example, for their new initiative at PBS, Rotenberg and the team chose to develop an offering for broadcast and digital, and they also decided not to partner with other outlets, as they had with Sprout.
The idea of choices is critical here, because, as Michael Porter famously said, “Strategy is as much about what you decide not to do, as what you dodo.” The mark of a failing strategy is trying to be all things to all people—and not having the courage of focus. The best strategies develop offerings targeting some unique and defensible sweet spot—a winning blend among multiple variables, for example, satisfying the needs of certain customers; doing that with the right combination of product or service attributes at the right cost; shaping the offerings on the basis of particular strengths of your team; and doing it all in a way that makes it hard for competitors to beat you at the same game. Find the right strategic sweet spot and you can win too.

The process of strategy
Of course, strategies sometimes fail (even spectacularly, as famous case studies will attest). Your growth as a leader must be built not just on suc-cesses but also on learning from your setbacks. Strategy making will pro-vide plenty of those, too, along the way. Don’t shrink from the challenges.But as a rising leader, you should also understand why strategies fail. 
Two common pitfalls are:
- Incorrectly assessing an external market situation or misjudging an internal capability needed for the strategy—or both
- Being surprised by a trend that suddenly changes the game of your business—for example, a new technology or unforeseen competitor that arises
In today’s dynamic global economy, such risks are increasingly common. You should do your best to minimize those risks, but even the savviest strategists can still get caught off guard.
The practice of strategy is changing as leaders more deliberately at-tempt to hedge against failure and adapt more nimbly to changing circum-stances. The lengthy, internally focused planning processes of yore have given way to much more fl exible, outward-facing, short-cycle, and learn-as-one-goes-along approaches—refl ecting the mindset and so-called lean methods seen in many Silicon Valley startups. (This kind of thinking was epitomized in Steve Blank’s HBRarticle “Why the Lean Start-Up Changes Everything,” but the concepts were introduced earlier in Rita Gunther McGrath and Ian Macmillan’s 1995 HBR article “Discovery-Driven Plan-ning.”) A lean approach may seem more informal and practical, but it is not without its own structure and logic. Great leaders still follow a deliberate and structured problem-solving process to identify critical choices and develop decisions to shape their strategies. And so should you.
So what are the essential steps? What is the best way to fi nd the right balance, on the one hand, between analysis and deliberation to make the right choices, and on the other, embracing speed, flexibility, and openness to adaptation, suited to today’s faster and more unpredictable climate?
Developing a process to make your strategic choices
You don’t frame and make such strategic choices in a vacuum. You iden-tify and shape them through a deliberate problem-solving process, work-ing with others, over time. Even if strategy making now happens faster, more informally, and more fl exibly than previous planning-intensive ap-proaches, some methodological discipline will sharpen your thinking and structure your learning. Let’s walk through some typical problem-solving steps to help you develop the right choices of a winning strategy.
Step 1. Set the stage
First, be clear what you’re generally trying to accomplish with your strat-egy making and how you want to go about it. Start with a simple checklist of key questions and tasks to guide your journey.
- Purpose. Why generally are you developing a new strategy? What’s driving the need or opportunity to do that? Do you need a fresh approach to achieving your vision, or do you have a new vision? Your strategy should begin by answering a simple powerful question about the intent of your effort.
  At PBS, Kerger helped focus Rotenberg’s desire to expand the children’s market with a new kids’ channel by asking if there was a need for that and, if so, could the network viably do it on its own?
- Audience and stakeholders. Who will the strategy potentially benefit, who must be involved in developing it, and who must ultimately approve it? Key stakeholders might be, for example, major influencers in the organization, board members, or frontline people who would have to be centrally involved in delivering the strategy. It might also, later if not sooner, include customers, partners, and other relevant players in the external environment. (You’ll have to balance the risk of potential competitors being alerted to your ideas through such external discussions with the benefi t of gaining valuable input.)
  At PBS, Kerger coached Rotenberg that the strategy, though ultimately aimed at children and parent viewers, would have to be built by—and ultimately be embraced by—both the broader orga-nization of PBS and the leaders of the network’s local stations.
- Scope, constraints, and potential implementation implications. What arenas and unit of analysis must the strategy be situated within? (That is, is the strategy for a particular business unit, initiative, or a broader part of the enterprise?) Are there limits or boundaries to what can be pursued from the outset? If the strategy is accepted, what ripple effects will follow? What are the implications for other corporate units? Customers? Brand identity? And so on.
At PBS, the new channel began as a service strategy within the children’s educational unit, but as it evolved, it touched most other parts of the organization. From the start, it was always seen as supporting the broader vision of the network. At the same time, Kerger imposed important constraints on the level of investment that would be available for the new service.
- Participants, engagement, deliverables. What kind of team will work to create the strategy? How will its members work with one another and the broader universe of stakeholders? Will there be off-sites, virtual meetings, multiple strategic planning ses-sions? How many, when, and so on? And what final form will the strategy take?
The creation of any strategy demands finding the right balance between involving key stakeholders and experts in the problem solving but also keeping the effort small enough to remain nimble and practical. The best projects, as the PBS team represented, are a hybrid: organized as a small central team that then involves other contributors periodically as needed. The team ultimately led by Rotenberg and Rubenstein was a core of children’s media and technical experts from different PBS units, but its members regularly met and shaped the project with input from other lead-ers and key staff from member stations across the system. (See the box “Don’t go it alone.”)
Don’t go it alone
Whatever your role (and relative authority), you should not assume that the strategy-making process rests only on your shoulders. You will have to approve what the strategy on your watch will be, but it’s important that you understand the constraints and opportunities under which you are operating and who else will have a share in the overall accountability. If you are asked to develop a strategy for your unit’s contribution to broader company strategy, you will likely receive a set of assumptions and resources that will bound the options you’ll be able to develop.
But whatever the scope of your ultimate strategy-making responsibility, resist the temptation to be the all-seeing, heroic decision maker. You’ll develop better options by listening to other people along the way—calling on other professionals, working collaboratively across and beyond the organization—to ensure that your process is identifying the right problem areas and exploring the most viable ideas. It’s also valu-able to get help and outside perspective on analyzing and modeling the fi nancial and implementation considerations of diff erent ideas. Fresh eyes can minimize what is often inevitable confirmation bias.
Great leaders we’ve spoken with stress the importance of letting go and being open to perspectives other than their own as they consider strategy solutions. Kerger readily admits today she was too skeptical when Rotenberg approached her about the new dedicated kids’ channel. It is to her credit that, even as she challenged her general manager, she kept an open mind about an initiative she had doubts about.
Trying to minimize your own personal prejudices is especially impor-tant when hearing objections and concerns about your ideas. The best leaders make a conscious effort to listen to others, and to know and restrain their own biases. Being able to hear dissent means that you’ll “understand why the status quo doesn’t have to be the way business is done,” in the wise words of Tamara Lundgren, CEO of Schnitzer Steel.
Furthermore, failing to take into account the viewpoints of others in your organization or immediate team means you’ll be taking all that work on yourself—and usually not for the better. As Charlie Brown, founder of the community design fi rm Context Partners, told us: “When I fi rst started my company, I felt the CEO job was to provide all the answers. I kept fl oundering until some employees and clients fi nally told me: ‘[Your company] will do much better if you stop trying to do it all yourself. The strategy needs to leverage a wider network of other people.’ I’ve now made that the rule for how we operate.”
As your team starts to work, identify the fi nal products your effort must produce and for whom: Will it be a written plan, a presentation for your boss, or an executive-style memo for your CEO? Will it include (as such things normally do) specific goals and objectives, a fit with a vision, analyses, a rationale for the initiative, a financial model, competitive analysis, an assessment of risks and rewards, and so on?
Give some initial thought to how you will communicate the fi nal strat-egy and extend it to the broader organization. Involving as many stake-holders as possible in the process—including frontline employees—will smooth the way for greater acceptance. For those not actively involved, good communication will be particularly necessary. At PBS, Kerger noted that a major success of the PBS KIDS 24/7 strategy was how broadly and continuously the team had built participation and enthusiasm across multiple units of the organization.
Step 2. Set strategic goals 
After such preliminaries, talk to your team about what success for the strat-egy making overall might look like—how to imagine what a great result would be. To get more concrete, think next about some specifi c goals and how the strategy will help move your organization toward whatever kind of future vision might be in place (see the box “Check in on your vision”).
Because lean-style strategy making involves iterative learning and evolution of thinking, different strategic choices will likely emerge through your process, but whatever the path forward, the fi nal measures of success (what you’re ultimately aiming to achieve) will likely stay pretty constant. Choose measures that clearly signify value and impact consistent with your team’s vision and the broader vision of your company. The goals you choose should resonate with your key stakeholders, too.
In the PBS KIDS case, Kerger and the strategy team agreed early on that the programming for the potential new channel would have to reach a particular audience size, measured by a threshold of member affi liates that would agree to carry the service; and they placed special emphasis on reaching more lower-income households. They also understood that the channel and its programming would have to be in line with the PBS mis-sion of educational improvement of the nation and the network’s corpo-rate strategy of building and distributing quality content, ensuring strong member stations, and promoting innovation.
Different businesses and different strategies will have different mea-sures of success. A business unit with a vision of, say, reaching a new level of market growth might set strategic goals that are top-line fi nancial tar-gets for specifi c customer segments or achieving a percentage of revenue derived from new products. For a civic or governmental organization com-mitted to, say, eliminating poverty, strategic goals might be providing a level of food and shelter security for a specifi c community or increasing its level of employment. For David Winn, who became CEO of the failing American Express Bank in France, the organizational vision was to revitalize the institution with the consumer fi nancial expertise of the global corporation; he set strategic goals to make the bank profitable again and expand market share against fi nancial competitors. General Stanley Mc-Chrystal’s mission when he took over the Joint Special Operations Com-mand in Iraq was to slow the terrorism of Al Qaeda; he was working toward a vision of establishing a more peaceful Iraq and Afghanistan that wouldn’t harbor terrorists. The strategic goal he set was to kill or capture as many Al Qaeda leaders as possible.
A good strategy should aspire to achieve a limited number of relevant goals that stakeholders of the organization can easily understand; it should also simply explain how achieving them will refl ect progress toward its vision. (Goals are usually further broken down into specifi c objectives and intermediate outcomes for executional planning; see chapter 4.)
Check in on your vision
Because great strategy fl ows from vision, early on you’ll need to check in on your team’s and your organization’s bigger pictures of success. This is where the vision practice comes into play. If your team doesn’t have a clear aspiration to rally around, you can’t do the strategy work to reach that kind of success: if you’re not clear about your destination, how can you choose any particular approach to get there? Clarity about your destination should also enable you to think more wisely about the different routes you ought to consider.
You must also ask yourself about your deeper motivation: is the de-sire for a new strategy really a desire for a new vision, too? Be honest. Sometimes, a team’s vision does need refreshing or altering; that may become clear only as you start to develop a new strategy.
Because vision and strategy are so closely related—“where we want to get to, how we will do it”—they often evolve in tandem. If you feel you have to develop (or newly develop) a vision together with strategy, don’t let the dual process become an endless loop or have your strategy force a larger change of purpose than the organization really needs. In the end, vision should be broad and durable enough to benefit from different strategies in different situations. As markets, technology, and competitive situations change, you may well need to develop new strategies to achieve the same picture of success embodied in your vision.

Step 3. Understand your current situation
Once you’ve set goals tied to your unit’s or your company’s larger vision and strategy, turn your team toward understanding the status quo. Make an honest appraisal of your team’s existing business—current performance, assets, capabilities, basis for competition, and so on. Then do the same for the world in which your unit and broader company operates, looking at how that landscape is changing (e.g., shifting consumer tastes, new com-petitors emerging, new technology restructuring business models, etc.) and the threats and opportunities that come with those changes. This dual assessment will provide the starting point for developing ideas and oppor-tunities to improve or even transform where and how you compete and deciding on a distinctive value proposition.
You can approach the appraisal of your existing team in many ways. It may vary depending on how well the performance of your company is already documented and understood, and the level of analytical rigor you feel is now needed. A radically lean effort might begin with minimal analysis or a starter sketch that is then iteratively tested and refi ned, but a few fundamental questions must nonetheless be addressed, for example, “Who are we today and how does that fi t with the external world and new challenges?”
Other frameworks can help with such questions. Consider, for exam-ple, Peter Drucker’s theory of the business—the often tacit assumptions of “policies, practices, and behaviors” about how (and how well) your com-pany operates and how well those fit today’s competitive climate. Or you may want to analyze your business model in more detail, which includes your key value proposition to customers; how you make money (which is important whether you are for-profit t or nonprofit); and the processes and resources you rely on to deliver value. The current situation appraisal should also consider aspects of talent, financial and technology resources, culture, brand, and similar assets to bring to your strategy for winning.
The second part of the task—understanding the external world in which you operate—is complex: you must consider not just existing mar-kets, customers, and competitors, but also those emerging and changing due to social, economic, and technological trends. This is also the time to assess major discontinuities in markets and how emerging new players are reinventing ways to serve the traditional needs of customers (including what Clayton Christensen has famously labeled disruption) or creating whole new markets that previously didn’t exist.
Frontline workers are important sources for getting these perspectives (another reason for including people with pivotal jobs in your strategic task force). In all cases, you should be sure to tap their experience and obser-vations—both about forces at work externally (changing customer needs, new competitors arising, pricing pressure, etc.) and internally (e.g., orga-nizational obstacles or operational ineffi ciencies blocking your company’s ability to compete).
Many off-the-shelf analyses assess internal and external issues, and armies of consultants are happy to help you further, often with their own special tools, including an increasing set of analytical and big data inter-pretative technologies. But beware: you can be easily overwhelmed by the amount of analysis you may think you have to do, even (and, sometimes, especially) when you have consultant help. (See the box “When to bring in consultants.”) Constraints and the pace of competition will here again force you to make some choices. Constantly ask yourself whether the on-going investigation is still adding substantial benefi t to the process. Keep building your experience about the kind of effort needed: ideally, when you’ve done enough to get the picture roughly right, but not so much that momentum and opportunity are lost due to analysis paralysis. These are judgment calls that distinguish effective from less effective leaders.
In the PBS case, Kerger challenged Rotenberg not only to explore the market need and station capacity for a stand-alone children’s channel, but also to leverage the knowledge of Rubenstein and his colleagues in the digital unit about technology’s evolving impact on the media landscape. That could have expanded into an almost endless research project, but by working with a few established experts, mining PBS’s already rich audience research, and also fiof various local station managers, the PBS strategy team found the right FOR of various local station managers, the PBS strategy team found the right balance to be sufficiently comperhesive-but-not needlessly exhaustive—to make the design choices required for a new channel.
When to bring in consultants
Strategy consultants can be helpful, but it’s a mistake to hand over all the thinking about your strategy to outsiders. You and your team may not have the capacity to run a strategy project alone, but you will need to be centrally involved and own the process. Consultants can minimize the burden by providing facilitation and specialized expertise. Consultants can also be helpful in holding up a mirror to your organization and framing questions objectively, without political bias. But the fi nal strategy must belong to you and your organization, not the outsiders. 
Identify key issues and problems to solve
In synthesizing your fi ndings from the internal and external investiga-tions, strive to identify the key issues and problems to solve, that is, where there’s a mismatch or clear opportunity arising when you compare trends or external conditions and what your organization is currently doing. Your central task is to select questions relevant to the strategy that will frame key choices and ultimately shape the overall strategy.
For example, as the research unfolded, the PBS team realized the strategy for the new children’s channel would have to address several critical issues: specifi cally designing the programming service for the channel to deepen engagement and learning opportunities with the tar-get audience of children in low-income households; identifying the most promising opportunities for integrating broadcast content with digi-tal games;  differentiating the new channel from others in the children’s media marketplace; determining the operational implications of the crossplatform approach; uncovering the financial and technical implications of adding a new channel to the operations of current member stations; and many others.
Step 4. Develop options for where and how to compete
Once you’re clear on your goals and understand your team’s current situation (both internally and externally), you can begin to identify the key choices deﬁning your strategy. The shorthand we’ve been using for strategy making—“deciding where and how to compete”—reﬂects the two core, interrelated decisions that represent your formula for making an impact in pursuit of your vision. They will ultimately frame the kind of sweet spot of unique and defensible value your strategy must strive to create.
Remember, as discussed in our original deﬁnition, “where” and “how” to compete are placeholders for several more subtle themes. “Where” might be literally geographical a particular market in France or a speciﬁc theater of operations in Iraq. But it can also signify a certain group of customers, deﬁned by selected demographic characteristics, or a group of companies in an industry sector, or making a division between wholesale and retail channels, or many other things. (Because segmentation of market opportunity has become its own rareﬁed science, you may need some specialized expertise to help.)
How to compete can refer to a product or a service, the particular markets through which you sell them, or some combination of both. “How” can also refer to the speciﬁc approach you choose for your packaging, pricing, branding, ﬁnancing, customer service, and many other things, including whether you do these things inhouse, purchase them from outside, or acquire new capabilities (see the box “Exploring make-or-buy and acquisition options”). “How” combines the “what,” “why,” and “in what manner” that you are using to create distinctive value for your “who.” In McChrystal’s military case, the how–to-compete issue turned on building a new culture of information sharing among disparate military and civilian units, so they would collaborate better and faster to strike terrorists across the Middle East. For Winn’s American Express bank, it was the design—features, pricing, regulatory compliance, check-writing services, interest-paying rates, and so on—of a new retail product at the heart of a transformed consumer strategy.
Exploring make-or-buy and acquisition options
A potential choice in the process is whether to make or buy the new products, services, or other sources of revenue on which the strategy will depend. Leaders will often look outside to do an acquisition or to develop a solution they think will be more cost-eﬀective, faster, or more innovative than what they can develop in their own company.
Acquiring another entity, whatever the reason, can be a large and fraught undertaking, and if you are not a CEO, it’s not likely something you’d pursue without a lot of support from more senior leaders. That said, if you still think such a move has value for your strategy, understand a few implication before you get started.
First, know that the shorthand phrase—“make versus buy”—sets up what might be a false binary choice. There is always a spectrum of other corporate options for developing new skills or assets to consider, including contracting for new services, forging product or market-speciﬁc partnerships, forming more extensive joint ventures, and the like (for more, see Laurence Capron and Will Mitchell’s book Build, Borrow, or Buy).
Second, make sure you’ve also really given the internal option a fair shake. You may have too quickly assumed that the knowledge, skills, or assets needed for your strategy don’t exist in your compay. Sometimes the resources required do exist internally, but they’re not in your speciﬁc part of the organization, or they’re not currently accessible because of how your company is structured. You can create new eﬃciencies or spark corporate innovation when separate units start collaborating across boundaries (as in the PBS case with the children’s media and digital units). If you’re developing new strategies for your unit, consider if you have colleagues elsewhere in the company with whom you can partner to achieve what’s needed and that could beneﬁt both of your units.
If a full-blown external acquisition is indeed the best answer for your new strategy, reach out early for the appropriate advice and support you need from your own leadership and relevant external experts. You can get ready for those discussions with some additional preparation:
1. Consider how a potential acquisition would directly enhance your speciﬁc strategy. Remember that acquisitions are only a tool to support a strategy, not a strategy itself. Know also that diﬀerent kinds of strategies will be served by diﬀerent kinds of acquisitions (e.g., depending on whether you are doing product extensions versus whole-scale reinvention of your business model; see the HBR article “The New M&A Playbook,” by Clayton Christensen et al.).
2. Face the fact that acquisitions are almost always more complicated and uncertain than they might seem at ﬁrst; research shows that some 70 percent fail or fall short of expectations. Are you ready to handle the potential ﬁnancial and reputational risk you and your company may be taking on if you move ahead?
3. Take advantage of some advance what-if scenario analysis to understand how viable your potential acqu sition can really be. Ron has laid out a framework for smart “backward planning” in his HBR article “Are You Really Ready for an Acquisition?” He suggested creating a high-level picture of what the combined company or merger would look like after a year of integration (ﬁnancing but also organizational structure, processes, culture, staﬃng, etc.) and then back-solving what it would take to get there, including resources and time (investment, teams, processes), governance and oversight, essential skills, and so on.
The PBS children’s channel focused on a strategy of “where” that would target children and parents (especially mothers) in member station communities and also particularly try to reach both children in lowerincome households without cable access and others using digital devices for streaming. The “how” of the strategy that eventually emerged was to develop a high-quality, curriculum-based, noncommercial educational service that was cross-platform in delivery and interactivity.

From problems to opportunities
To begin developing the “where” and “how” choices for your strategy, consider the problems you identiﬁed in the previous step—for example, an outof-date business model, encroaching competitors, maturing product lines, and so on. As you consider these problems, your analysis may well suggest new ideas to do something excitingly better and different. Look for opportunities for winning in some new way, suited to the changing environment, such as leveraging a new technology to improve your cost position, redeploying your talent to improve a customer experience, or adapting products to changing cultural tastes. You may also want to consider whether partnering or even acquiring another business may open new opportunities for creating more value for customers. Keep asking yourself and your strategy team: Is there something superior and distinctive we could do, in light of what we’re learning about our company and its competitive, external operating context?
Developing the best strategic options requires creativity in addition to analytic skills. Leaders can often boost creative capability by examining innovative approaches to growth in other businesses and brainstorming whether there are patterns that they could adapt to their own company. You can also ﬁnd fresh thinking outside your strategy-making team: have the members brainstorm with your frontline people, explore new innovative approaches by collaborating with lead customers, or call on networks beyond your company. For example, you could partner with a university or design ﬁrm, or work with outside experts to adapt a wholly different business model from another industry.
Throughout our executive interviews, we constantly heard about strategy making that was based on options developed by learning from others—McKinsey’s global managing partner Dominic Barton raising up innovative client service approaches that were being experimented with in different corners of the ﬁrm’s global network; Tamara Lundgren applying new approaches to mortgage securitization in Europe based on technologies she had utilized in the United States to create more innovative products earlier in her career for Deutsche Bank; Stan McChrystal literally borrowing some of the network organization’s playbook from his enemy to create the more nimble, information-sharing culture of Allied Special Operations in Iraq. At PBS, with Kerger coaching her, Rotenberg expanded her horizons by engaging other colleagues who, with her, developed the idea of a combined broadcast and digital service, with crossover content and interactive learning games linked to the broadcast programming.

Narrowing the possibilities
The PBS strategy team ﬂeshed out its ﬁnal strategic choices through more discussion and problem solving between the broadcast and digital units of the organization, and its ongoing research with member stations, too—allowing all stakeholders to learn from one another and understand the costs and beneﬁts of a dedicated, multiplatform channel. The team was able to ﬁnalize decisions based on some fact-based projections of audience size and a lot of carefully collected and analyzed feedback from—and speciﬁc commitments made by—local stations in the network.
As you start to develop different options for your strategy—by exploring different combinations of where and how to compete—you’ll need to identify certain ﬁlters for making your ﬁnal bets. One set of ﬁlters should be Porter’s ﬁve essential tests of a good strategy (see the box “Five tests for your strategy”). Beyond those, a few other usual suspects should also be part of your investigations: standard cost, beneﬁt, risk considerations; the likelihood that your organization can deliver on the value proposition; how much ﬂexibility you have to fall back on or change direction if the new strategy doesn’t work out; whether a particular option will also provide learning to more generally improve future performance; and, of course, how well the strategy ﬁts with your vision for the group, as well as the strategy and vision of your organization overall.
Five tests for your strategy
In her book Understanding Michael Porter, Joan Magretta distills Porter’s principles of creating and sustaining competitive advantage down to ﬁve tests. You’ve seen how Kerger and Rotenberg and the team shaped their strategy around these kinds of elements; you can also use them to make your own key decisions. Every good strategy must have:
- A distinctive value proposition. The decisions you make about where and how to compete are trade-oﬀs—within the context of your larger company, which customers will you choose to serve, and which of their needs, with which oﬀerings, packaging, pricing, and so forth? How will these be better than and diﬀerent from alternatives in the marketplace?
- A tailored value chain It’s one thing to come up with a unique oﬀering for a selected target audience, but you also must deliver on it, especially in a way that would be diﬃcult to replicate by competitors. This may mean changing how you work, restructuring your organization, or taking on (or cutting back on) additional costs.
- Trade-oﬀs that enable your diﬀerentiation from rivals. As we’ve mentioned, strategy is as much about what you decide not to do, because without focusing your eﬀort and resources, it will be diﬃcult to reach a threshold of being distinctive in something. A lack of focus waters down the emphasis and energy you’re trying to compete with against other players. Because no organization can be all things to all customers, and resources are never inﬁnite, you’ll have to stop doing some things. Choose the right ones.
- Strategic ﬁt. The concept of strategic ﬁt is elusive but important—making sure the strategy is designed and tailored to do what your organization does better than others, accords with your culture and values, and calls on internal capabilities that are well aligned with the external needs you are serving. When the parts of your strategy ﬁt together seamlessly and naturally, it works like a self-amplifying system, providing what some strategy experts have called “a coherence premium” (see Paul Leinwand and Cesare Manardi’s HBR article “The Coherence Premium”).
- Continuity over time. Though strategies inevitably require new thinking and new ways of working, changing too much or too quickly can undermine success, too. Innovation should not burn all bridges with your heritage, lest you confuse customers or undo the trust on which your future relationships will depend.
As you start to formulate different options, you’ll feel the risks and pressure to make the right choices. Careful analysis and using the right ﬁlters will be critical, but bear in mind that going from “where we are” to “where we want to be” can’t be achieved only by rational calculation. You can’t analyze your way into some brilliant new way of operating, nor can you surely predict what new product or service is going to take off and help your organization soar. Improve your chances of success by also considering less tangible factors, for example, how urgent the need for a new strategy may be; whether the timing is right to make a big change or it’s better to wait until later; how emotionally ready your team is to undertake a certain new strategy idea versus another; the potential ripple effects—both positive and negative—on the organization beyond your own unit or operating group; whether you have the talent on board to do what’s needed, and if not, whether you can ﬁnd and hire them quickly enough; and whether you yourself have enough conﬁdence and strength to do what’s needed. Which now brings us to you and your leadership role in getting to ﬁnal decisions and action.
Step 5. Assess options, engage stakeholders, move toward decision
As smart and hardworking as your strategy team may be, it won’t get everything right the ﬁrst time around, and you as the leader must set the tone for your people to learn and adapt toward the best possible answers. New information will appear, situations will change, bugs will surface that will reveal ﬂaws in your “where” and “how” choices. Good strategy making, especially in today’s operating climate, is more of an ongoing process than a decision that you make once and forever. The recognition of this reality is why lean approaches are growing in popularity, shifting away from more static strategy formulation and planning that presupposed completeness once key senior leaders had spoken.
That’s not to say that developing strategy doesn’t require some ﬁnal decision making and, indeed, moving from analyzing and debating options to real action. Knowing when to make that critical shift is where good leadership makes a real difference. The boundary between such steps is more blurred now, and strategy is generally more iterative—marked by testing, learning, and continuous adjustment, not punctuated ﬁnality. In its own simple way, the PBS KIDS 24/7 story, with a solution that slowly evolved and improved over time, is one more example of the trend.
As you develop your own strategy, consider embracing at least two learn-by-doing aspects of the lean startup approach. First, as you identify different options of where and how to compete, try out the ideas with key stakeholders whom you identiﬁed earlier in the process and reﬁne accordingly.
Second, consider taking a further step to test your ideas—literally run trials or experiments of your most promising options (e.g., building a pro-totype, mock-up, or simulation of your product or service, and then sharing it with stakeholders to observe usage, bugs, and operational challenges).
Such testing will reveal what works and what doesn’t, and you’ll doubtless gain insights to make your strategy even better. Testing can also break the paralysis of uncertainty, as Ron and Logan Chandler wrote in their HBR article “Four Tips for Better Strategic Planning.” Finally, testing and experimentation can help you more deeply understand barriers to overcome and the resources and systems for implementation at scale. It could also highlight new aspects of value that you can package and sell, or add to your marketing campaign.
You can use testing for any strategy-making process, though your situation may call for different levels of rigor. Common practices include setting up speciﬁc hypotheses to test, comparison between control groups and groups experiencing the new product or service, iterative reﬁnement of the offering based on earlier rounds of testing, and so on. At key intervals, your strategy-making team should reﬂect on what it’s learning and brainstorm changes to improve chances of success.
The PBS KIDS 2 /7 strategy mostly involved packaging and distributing content already known to member stations, so the team did only minimal and informal testing of that, mostly by discussing sample programming schedules with other leaders. But the incorporation of gaming and digital streaming products was much more experimental, and the team created some simple prototypes to help network executives understand and critique the concept and to test it with target audiences. The team also leveraged existing research funded by the US Department of Education’s Ready to Learn grant, which validated the educational beneﬁts of combining broadcast programs with game play linked to the same learning goals.

Avoid indecision
Testing, learning, and evolving a strategy must not, however, become an excuse for extended indecision. As a leader you must be both open to new ideas but also committed to action. You can’t develop strategic options forever. At some point, you have to freeze the code and commit to a strategy, or risk losing valuable momentum. Thus, at PBS, after a year of development and testing, Kerger and the team ofﬁcially launched PBS KIDS 24/7 in partnership with member stations.
That’s not to say you shouldn’t still seek learning and improvement even after a strategy has been rolled out; it’s always right to correct missteps and reﬁne improvements over time. But after the initial process of development and testing, teams need a clear signal to move ahead and commit to coordinated action. Finding the right time to do that—knowing when you’ve not only analyzed enough but also done enough real-world testing to shake out remaining practical problems and adapt accordingly—and then having the courage to move forward is the critical purview of the leader. As you develop strategy, watch for the right window to make that decision.
Step 6. Allocate resources and manage implementation
The clearest signal that you are truly launching a strategy is when you begin to allocate resources and build implementation into your operational processes. This, too, requires some advance thinking and preparation. Toward the end of any strategy-making process, you will have to do more detailed ﬁnancial and organizational modeling—analyzing the investment and people needed, additions or modiﬁcations of infrastructure, changes in organizational structure and responsibilities, and so on.
Once you’ve agreed on a ﬁnal strategy, you and your team must build the choices and decisions into existing systems for your company: you must integrate funding, cost allocations, and expected revenue (as appropriate) into your budgeting process. You must accommodate any new recruiting and training within your company’s HR systems. You must introduce any new operational, technology, and infrastructure requirements of the strategy into other functions as appropriate (for more details, see chapters 3 and 4).
But throwing the implementation switch is not purely mechanical. You as the leader must also ensure that your organization embraces and pursues the new strategy in a way that generates the results you hope for. To do that, you’ll want to pay special attention that the strategy is managed for the highest possible performance—focused clearly on appropriately aggressive goals, well integrated into performance reviews, freed from what may be constraining barriers in the structure and culture of your organization, and similar (more on this in chapter 4).
In addition to providing for the operational integration of implementation, there are a few additional steps you should consider to get your strategy off on the right foot and build critical early momentum.

Focus investment
Planning and testing is always easier than ﬁnally committing to the public launch of something new. Once you give the green light, you might be on the way to becoming a hero, but even a promising strategy might fall ﬂat and open you up to criticism or worse. But when you’re ready, have the courage to move forward and accept the consequences, because unless you enter the game, you will certainly be seen as a failure. Too many leaders undermine their chances of success by ﬂinching at the moment of execution.
Anne Mulcahy, again reﬂecting on her Xerox turnaround, emphasized the importance of considering resource allocation as a leader: “Much of the leadership I had to exercise was ﬁghting to secure the right funding and people needed for the new initiatives. Leaders often don’t want to expose themselves to failure by making the hard decisions, so they suboptimize and put a little money here, a little money there, and nothing has enough oomph to break through. Those decisions are really difﬁcult, because inevitably you’re taking money away from one group to support another.”
As implementation starts to move ahead, you’ll also have to keep enforcing discipline on what the unit has to stop doing to maintain the focus of your strategy. Just because everyone seemed to agree in this or that workshop about making a major shift, or shutting down this or that older initiative, doesn’t mean they will follow through on their promises. Institutions are hard to change, and the anchor of tradition and what’s familiar can be very heavy. PBS, in order to pay for the new dedicated children’s channel, had to postpone the launch of new individual shows and undertake some organizational restructuring. Kerger had to make and enforce what were ultimately some difﬁcult decisions.
 
Communicate clearly
Any strategy-development process will have its share of complexity. Your job as a leader is also to simplify and communicate your choices about where and how the team will now play—and why. Everyone in the unit and other stakeholders (colleagues in the organization, board members, customers, investors, partners, etc.)  must understand what the  strategy intends, why speciﬁc goals are targets, and how the team will achieve them.
Keep your key messages short, powerful, and easy to understand; they should clearly connect strategy to the vision and mission. Repeat them constantly, in every interaction you have with your stakeholders, and make clear what the strategy will mean for each of them. (The discussion and experimentation you’ve had along the way will mean that the key tenets will not be surprising, but they will still need to be constantly reinforced.) Mulcahy engaged the people at Xerox constantly during the company’s strategic transformation. As she met with stakeholders worldwide, she always explained how their particular work could help the company’s strategic efforts. By staying away from conceptual executive speak and ad-dressing the implications for change in a targeted, practical way, she was able to make the strategic transformation personally meaningful.
At PBS, Kerger continues to allocate signiﬁcant time to promoting PBS KIDS to the system and a wide range of stakeholders—speaking candidly and personally about the importance of the strategy and its ﬁt with her vision and the broader educational mission of PBS. She is methodical in reaching out to different leaders across the organization, her board, station managers, and other community leaders in the PBS network. She also now regularly references PBS KIDS 24/7 in her outreach to current and future donors across the system.

Keep learning, keep adapting
The notion that strategies must be continuously renewed is not new, but the pressure on organizations to do that is harsher than ever before. The rise of lean and learn-by-doing approaches to strategy reﬂect a new generation of organizations ﬁnding ways to adapt to a more volatile and competitive climate. To help with the shift, they are using new technologies to collect and analyze large amounts of customer and market data, including, in real time, enabling faster tailoring of product or service offerings as change unfolds.
Similarly, at PBS, the national ofﬁce monitors viewership progress of the new children’s channel and continues to collect feedback through audience data analysis and ongoing discussions with local station leaders. It has integrated PBS KIDS 24/7 into regular planning and operations for all PBS national units, and managers continue to work with content producers and curriculum advisers to reﬁne the various offerings.
As a leader, you should embrace such tools, but don’t confuse technology with human judgment or assume that more data analytics is all you need: if you’re going to keep your strategy fresh and relevant, you must keep challenging the organization with these questions: Why is a particular strategy working or not? Why are changes in markets opening up new problems or opportunities? What, in fact, does that mean for our strategy now—and tomorrow? Leaders lead strategy making by leading the learning that must continuously shape it, while also looking to reinvent it periodically through more dramatic innovation over time. (For more on this, see chapter 5.)
Are you ready to lead a strategy-making process?
Kerger brought good judgment and a willingness to help a passionate, bottom-up, cross-functional team succeed in its development of a successful new kids’ channel strategy. The team members’ willingness to collaborate and learn from each other, plus some fortuitous timing and even a little luck, all contributed to that success. In the end, however, the most critical factor was the disciplined problem-solving and iterative learning approach Kerger encouraged the team to follow. Its analysis of markets and opportunities, engagement with other leaders and experts across the system, and then the continual reﬁnement and improvement of the concept that it developed over the course of a year allowed PBS to navigate key strategic choices about where and how to create new and distinctive value within its educational mission.
If you are an emerging leader in a larger organization, be alert to strategy-making opportunities to build your knowledge and skills. You might be invited—or raise your hand—to develop strategy for a new product or create a localized strategy to start a process of innovation or some broader transformation for your ﬁrm. Or you may have a chance to develop a strategy outside the boundaries of a traditional corporate structure, for example, with a consortium of partners working on a collaborative venture, or to help launch a new experimental initiative or social advocacy program your company is sponsoring. Every opportunity to develop new forms of value, requiring informed choices about where and how to compete within a particular domain, and then turning those choices into wellaligned action, can provide you with valuable experience—teaching you how to work toward your vision and achieve impact through the focused power of people working together.
 Questions to Consider
■ Starting point. Do you have a strategy for your unit or team that supports the company’s current vision and overall strategy? Is it clear what your team needs to do—or not do—in order to really make a diﬀerence? Is there good reason to rethink your strategy now? If so, can you articulate success and then set goals for a new strategy?
■ Audience. Who is the audience for your team’s strategy—your boss, the senior executive team, your customers, other parts of your organization, your employees, or all of the above? How can you align these stakeholders, particularly if they have diﬀerent expectations?
 ■ Key issues and challenges. What current challenges are facing your team? Are external threats or changes in markets, technology, or competition pressuring your business? What internal challenges are you also facing? Are you competing with others for talent or budget? How will you sharpen your understanding of these issues? Are you doing things that don’t add value and you should stop?
 ■ Opportunities. What opportunities does your team or unit have for adding signiﬁcant new value to your organization and your customers? Are there services or products that you can provide better, faster, or cheaper than anyone else? What’s the distinct value that you can bring that will diﬀerentiate your team from others? Is there data that can help you conﬁrm these opportunities?
■ New thinking. What new, creative approaches can you take to improve your team’s work and increase the impact of your team’s contributions? Are there new products or services to oﬀer? How can you tap into your team’s wisdom and experience to identify new opportunities?
 ■ Options and choices. What choices about what to do and what not to do should be the basis of your team’s strategy? How might these play out and what would it take to move in each direction? Are certain options more distinctive and harder for competitors to follow? Do certain options ﬁt better with your company and skills, and lay a foundation for more future growth? How can you quickly test your preferred options with customers, executives, and other stakeholders and then use the data to iterate and improve your strategy?
 ■ Allocate resources. What are the resource implications of your team’s strategy? Do you need more budget or diﬀerent capabilities? Are you giving your team members the resources they need to be successful?
 ■ Implementation. How will you assign accountability and track progress of your team’s strategy? How can you do this in a way that allows for continual learning, midcourse corrections, and the development of sustaining capability?

3. Getting GreatPeople on Board
I believe the real diﬀerence between success and failure in a corporation can be very often traced to the question of how well the organization brings out the great energies and talents of its people.
—Thomas J. Watson Jr.
In chapter 2, we talked about how to translate your team’s vision into a tangible and measurable strategy to address an environment with changing technology, market opportunities, and customer needs. To execute the strategy, however, you need to get the right people on board. After all, a key part of our deﬁnition of leadership is that much of your impact is through others. That means building a leadership team and an organization with the best talent and the right skills for executing your strategy, and motivating them to do so to the best of their abilities.
To do this, you need to achieve a ﬁne balance between putting the organization’s needs ﬁrst while also respecting the needs and desires of your staff as they pursue their professional and personal aspirations. People join organizations voluntarily, with the assumption that their participation is a two-way street. If they give their best efforts to achieve the collective goals that you lay out, they expect to be rewarded, in terms of compensation, growth, job satisfaction, relationships, and more. This is the basic social contract of organizational life, and when it works, your team is more likely to perform at a high level with committed, loyal, and motivated people. 
As a leader, you are the creator and steward of this social contract, whether for the whole organization or your part of it; thus you need to honor both sides as you make decisions about stafﬁng, organizational structure, development, and compensation. Good leaders don’t obsessively drive for performance goals in ruthless ways that leave a trail of bodies (or unhappy people) in their wake. But they also aren’t so concerned about making everybody happy that they avoid conﬂicts and hard decisions and end up not achieving the needed results. Good leaders thread the needle between these extremes so that the organization has the right people on board to execute strategy and get results—and they feel good about being part of the collective endeavor.
But threading this needle can be challenging. Frequently, the individual’s and the organization’s interests can seem mis ligned. What happens
if, in order to achieve your strategic goals, you need to lay someone off or ﬁre them? What if they want to be paid more than you can give? And developing people by giving them tough feedback can be in the best interest of both the individual and the overall company, but it still isn’t pleasant or easy. Engagement is hard to pin down; not everyone is motivated by the same things. Convincing people to change or grow can be difﬁcult; culture is deeply rooted in organizations. And managing the social contract for your whole department or unit is challenging when most of your interactions are primarily with your direct reports, and it just seems that so many of these things might be easier to hand off to human resources.
To confront these challenges, your particular focus as a leader needs to be on building your direct reports into a strong team of results-producing leaders and managers who also understand and honor the social contract, and can multiply your commitment to it through the rest of your organization. Doing this includes ﬁve elements:
- Finding the right mix of leaders and managers to work directly with you to execute the strategy and helping those people work together effectively, across functions and silos
- Ensuring that your direct reports get the feedback they need to either get better at their jobs or make the decision to go elsewhere, and that they do the same with their people
- Creating opportunities for great people to learn, grow, and develop
- Articulating an explicit incentives philosophy that motivates your direct reports and all of your people to do the right things, for both the organization and themselves
- Combining these steps into an organizational or team culture that can enable strategic change
To start, let’s look at a case that illustrates the tension between achieving organizational objectives and honoring individual aspirations.
Managing the social contract through strategic change at the Ford Foundation
When Darren Walker became president of the Ford Foundation in 2013, he identiﬁed a new strategy for achieving the organization’s vision of reducing inequality and injustice, strengthening democratic values, promoting international cooperation, and advancing human achievement: the foundation would have to take a more digitally focused approach to its work. Walker explained: “The rise of the digitally connected world presents a threat to social justice that we hadn’t been aware of, such as internet freedom and net neutrality, the creation of open and free access platforms, and the challenge of a single lane internet vs. fast lanes given to the wealthy. In addition, all of the things in an analog world that are discriminatory and unjust, like bullying, wage inequality, and predatory lending, are replicated in the digital world.”
As Walker dug deeper into this issue, he realized that many of the people reporting to him, and others below them, were not well prepared to tackle these issues. It wasn’t a matter of motivation or commitment, but rather one of understanding and skill. There were few digital natives on the foundation’s staff, much less the executive team. Walker thus faced a challenge: despite good will on both sides, there was a gap between the strategic needs of the organization and the capability of its people to carry it out. Walker’s job as leader was to close the gap as quickly as possible.
Walker considered his options. Should he ratchet down his strategic expectations to match what his people could do? He didn’t see this as aviable option, since that would weaken the effectiveness and competitive position of the foundation. Another equally unappealing option was to replace many long-standing, highly committed, and loyal staff with new digitally savvy people who could quickly grasp the new strategic agenda. But that would compromise current programs, create negative publicity, and destroy remaining and future employees’ faith in the social contract that they had signed up for, destroying morale and productivity in the process. Walker was also aware that ﬁring people for no fault of their own would breach the very principles of social justice that the foundation stood for. Walker was ﬁrm on this point: “How do you stand before the staff and say to many of them who came to the foundation because they had the skill to work in social justice, that they are missing a critical skill needed to work on social justice in the twenty-ﬁrst century?”
Walker found a third option, however, that allowed him to meet both the organizational and the people sides of the equation as much as possible. The solution involved a careful combination of the options: some new hires, some staff reductions, and retention of a signiﬁcant number of current staff, but with changing expectations supported by development and retraining, extensive performance feedback, and new goals and incentives. “Technology fellows” were new hires introduced into each program area. These digital technologists had the task of rapidly familiarizing existing program staff with the digital world. Walker and his team also changed the job descriptions for new program ofﬁcers to require some experience with coding and a basic knowledge of the digital landscape in addition to their own ﬁeld. Finally, they changed the actual programs to focus on creating a new ﬁeld of internet rights, marrying human rights to understanding technology and media, and lots more.
Though this solution proved to be a good one, it was still a wrenching and difﬁcult change for the organization and for Walker, particularly since he knew that not everyone could make the shift successfully. But he was clear and candid in his communications: “I had to deliver a tough-love message, saying to people that while we had a lot to be proud of, if we continued on that path, a lot of them would be irrelevant. I also had to be frank about the fact that some of them wouldn’t make it. It wasn’t easy.”
Assembling your leadership team
Walker’s story demonstrates how difﬁcult it is to get the right skills and capabilities to pursue your strategic goals, while also respecting everyone’s security and well-being. But the reality is that just as strategy development is a continuous process, you will need to be continually making related stafﬁng decisions. That’s true at the scale of the whole organization, and particularly within your own department or team.
Every leader, at every level, needs to have a top-notch team to help develop and then execute strategy, and drive the organization forward. But the direct report team is especially important because its work cascades down to everything else the department or organization does. Sometimes you’ll need to recruit the team or part of it, but most of the time, you’ll inherit a team already in place. As Walker did with his leaders, you’ll need to make sure that all members of the team have the capability to fulﬁll their particular roles and collaborate with others as needed in order to achieve the organization’s goals.
So what are the most important things to consider when looking for the right people for your leadership team? And how do you assess whether those you already have can make the cut?
Recruit the right leaders
As you consider your team of direct reports, you’ll need to create a list of critical attributes that reﬂect what you think will be most important for executing your strategy and getting things done. For example, ConAgra’s former CEO Gary Rodkin made a list that included technical excellence, vulnerability, the ability to communicate and develop people, time management, and basic people skills. You also should look for skills that allow your team members themselves to be great leaders of their own teams (see more on this in the section “Build Your Team and Coordinate an Organization of Teams” later in this chapter). We believe that two such skills are particularly important across sectors and industries at all levels: adapt-ability and emotional intelligence.
Claudio Fernández-Aráoz, a senior fellow at the Harvard Business School and an experienced recruiting professional, provides useful guidance on recruiting adaptable leaders in his HBR article “21st-Century Talent Spotting.” Fernández-Aráoz argues that rather than technical skill or speciﬁc knowledge, the most critical characteristic that leaders should look for in selecting people is potential, “the ability to adapt to and grow into increasingly complex roles and environments.” This approach recognizes the pace of change in a global, digital world in which the skills and competencies important in the past might not be relevant for future challenges.
Emotional intelligence is also increasingly seen as critical for leaders across functions, especially as organizations become ﬂatter and managing in a collaborative way becomes more crucial. Daniel Goleman and his colleagues’ pioneering research has shown that leaders who are aware of their and others’ emotions and who are able to moderate their own emotional responses also have more ability to create great organizations and teams. (Goleman and his coauthors describe the hallmarks of emotional leadership in their classic HBR articles “What Makes a Leader?” and “Primal Leadership: The Hidden Driver of Great Performance.”)
Finding people who meet your criteria doesn’t mean that all your direct reports need to look alike, act alike, or think alike. Recruiting people with complementary and diverse skills is equally important. As a leader, you must mix and match talents, backgrounds, and tendencies (including your own) in a way that will allow your team to succeed collectively. So as you build your team, assess current strengths and backgrounds. Are there any that are missing? Who in your organization might have those qualities? Also look at personality types to make sure you have a mix of people who are different enough to spark creative thought, but still able to collaborate. 
Venture investor Bob Proctor compares this process to constructing a dynamic jigsaw puzzle. He spends much of his time making sure that the startup companies in his portfolio have leadership teams with the right mix of skills and thought processes, and that the companies’ leadership recognizes who’s good at what and builds roles around them and what they excel in. You can do this formally as you build or develop your team by using one of the personality-style assessment tools available in the market. Although none of them is perfect, they provide interesting insights into different ways that people approach problems, communicate, and think. You also can get the measure of current and potential team members by giving them problems to solve, asking them to make a presentation, conducting role-plays, or ﬁnding ways to have them interact with other members of your team. All these methods will give you more insight than just checking résumés and conducting one-on-one interviews.
As you focus on other members of your team, also pay particular attention to your own gaps. Anne Mulcahy, the former turnaround CEO of Xerox whom we met in chapters 1 and 2, for example, did not consider herself to be a very strong strategist. Most of her career had been in sales and operations, so her strengths were in people and communications. When she became CEO, she realized that strategic capability would be critical, so she made sure that at least two other senior executives had those skills when putting together her leadership team.
Make the tough decisions
Identifying the right people for your leadership team also goes hand in hand with identifying those team members who should no longer remain. Jack Welch, the legendary former CEO of GE, used to say that leaders need to be “hard-headed and soft-hearted.” As a leader, you need to be totally dispassionate about getting the right people in place in order to implement your strategy and get results, but still be personally compassionate about how those choices affect the individuals involved.
How solid is the social contract on your team?
 The tension between achieving strategic goals and honoring the social contract exists at every level of the organization and isn’t just an issue for CEOs and senior leaders. Team members expect that in return for their best eﬀorts, they will receive compensation; have opportunities to grow, learn, advance, and build relationships; and have a safe, stimulating work environment. At the same time, as their leader, you expect them to put their heart and soul into the work and produce great results. 
In many instances, however, the pressures and demands of getting work done and the expectations and performance of team members don’t fully match, and the fabric of the social contract begins to fray. As a leader, you need to look out for the warning signs of that happening so that you can take action as early as possible. These warning signs might include:
- People on your team worrying about getting credit or recognition for their contributions, which can signal adequately rewarded
- Team members competing for plum assignments, complaining that they are not getting suﬃcient opportunities, or actively looking for other jobs, which may suggest a lack of development options
- Increasing backlogs of work without a clear sense of how to get it all done or problems with quality or ability to meet commitments, which may mean that some of your people are not up to the task or you don’t have suﬃcient resources
- Conﬂicts between team members, either openly or in passive-aggressive ways, which may indicate that the social and working environment is not healthy
- Withholding information others need to succeed or setting othersup for failure, which can be signs of a toxic workplace
As a leader, you can’t always m ke everyone happy while achieving your goals, but you can watch for indicators that the social contract isn’t working. So take a look at your team and ask yourself whether the social contract is being met or is showing signs of wear and tear.
This means that if one of your direct reports isn’t working out—they’re not the right ﬁt, or they’re not performing despite whatever guidance and support you’ve given them—you need to take them off the team. That may not necessarily mean letting them go; you may be able to ﬁnd a role that is a better ﬁt for their skills elsewhere in the organization. Finding the right place for them is a compassionate way of removing them from the team, but so is being candid about exactly where they didn’t perform so that they can improve, either at another position in your ﬁrm or elsewhere. Letting them stay and continue to fail or feel uncomfortable, however, is not compassionate, is not upholding your end of the social contract, and is actually doing a disservice to that person and to the rest of your team. (For more on how the social contract can play out on a team level, see the box “How solid is the social contract on your team?”)
What does the combination of dispassion and compassion look like? Years ago, Welch asked one of his top leaders to come to his ofﬁce during the week between Christmas and New Year’s Day. The leader, who ran a multibillion-dollar business and had met his revenue and proﬁtability targets for the year, thought that the meeting was going to be about his bonus or possibly even a promotion to run one of GE’s larger units. Instead, Welch told him that he was being let go because his leadership style was autocratic and based on fear, completely contrary to GE’s values. Welch had told him this numerous times in the past year, but he hadn’t taken it seriously. After some tough discussion, the business leader accepted the rationale for his departure and saw it as a wake-up call. He went on to be-come the CEO of another company where he paid a great deal of attention to more effectively balancing his top-down, results-producing style with the growth and well-being of his team. In retrospect, he later said that this experience, despite the pain, was one of the best learning moments of his career.
Building, ﬁne-tuning, and maintaining your leadership team is a continuous challenge. Strategies change. Customer needs evolve. Markets shift and new technologies emerge. And often people—at all levels of the organization—cannot adapt to the changes in their environment. Adjusting for this starts with the people who report to you.
Build your team and coordinate an organization of teams
Once you have the right people on your staff, you still have to put them together to form a team. Building a high-performing leadership team doesn’t usually happen by itself, however. You can’t just put a collection of talented people in a room, lock the door, and wait for a cohesive group to emerge. As a leader, you have to actively help your direct reports come together.
This is vital because your people are likely to have greater impact by working together and because teamwork is a critical part of the social contract. Most research shows that people’s satisfaction at work is determined not only by what they do, but also by whom they do it with—both their immediate supervisor and their coworkers, whether they belong to lower-level teams or more senior leadership teams. So having productive, supportive, and collaborative relationships between your direct reports is a key factor in ensuring that your people are motivated, engaged, and committed to your vision and strategy. Building this kind of teamwork also multiplies your impact. For example, the shift to a digital mindset at the Ford Foundation ultimately was not driven by Walker alone, but by his senior leaders as well.
Coalescing strong and capable individuals into a high-performance team takes work. As a leader, you must do so deliberately. Based on years of research into team performance, Martine Haas and Mark Mortensen suggest four key steps in their HBR article “The Secrets of Great Teamwork”:
1. Ensure that your team has one or more common and compelling goals that require everyone to contribute in some way. At the Ford Foundation, the senior team was collectively responsible for driving a digital mindset into every program and aspect of the foundation’s work. To make that happen, all of the senior leaders had to not only take action within their own areas, but also look at the implications across programs and functions, and act as an overall steering group for the transition to digital.
2. Create an agreed-on structure for how the team will work together, including norms of behavior, sharing information, when and how to hold meetings, communication patterns, and clarity of assignments. This doesn’t mean that you dictate to everyone how the team will work, but rather that you discuss these issues with your team explicitly so that the structure becomes solidiﬁed.
3. Provide the support needed for the team to succeed, such as education, access to resources, budgets, coaching, and the like. At the Ford Foundation, the provision of digital fellows to senior team members is a good example. Support, however, also means psychological support so that your team members feel that they can get help and constructive feedback from each other rather than attacks and put-downs.
4. Foster a shared mindset and sense of identity with the team. Particularly in organizations where team members may be dispersed, traveling frequently, and connecting virtually, you need to encourage-age people to develop personal relationships and get to know each other beyond just the immediate tasks and roles. Find time for offsite sessions, unstructured discussions, dinners, and occasional fun activities, sometimes including spouses and signiﬁcant others—all of which can help bring your team together.

Your team of direct reports, however, is not likely to constitute the only team in your scope of responsibility. Your direct reports may also have teams reporting to them and so forth down the line. So the way your direct team operates can create a model for the others.
Furthermore, your organization probably also has many crossfunctional teams for product development, customer service, systems introductions, and the like. In addition, your ﬁrm might have occasional or standing teams that include people from outside organizations, such as open innovation forums or corporate social responsibility initiatives, and you may run or participate in some of these. As a leader, you need to ensure that the multiple teams that constitute your organizational ecosystem are functioning together as well as possible. (See the box “The importance of thinking horizontally.”)
New patterns of ﬂexible and agile interactions between these kinds of networks of teams have recently been reinforced by General Stanley McChrystal, former commander of US Special Forces in Afghanistan (see his book, Team of Teams). McChrystal emphasizes that traditional top-down leadership is no longer effective in warfare when the enemy is a decentralized network that changes strategies and tactics almost instantaneously. Instead, troops on the ground have to understand the overriding mission that they are to accomplish, have all the information and training possible, and then have the freedom to make their own decisions in the context of the mission. Moreover, these troops have to operate not only as effective teams on their own, but also as teams of teams that can coordinate their efforts with other units rapidly and ﬂexibly.
These lessons apply to all types of organizations that operate in fast-changing, unpredictable environments, which is almost every organization. As a team or department leader, you should:
- Encourage your team of direct reports to interact, share information, collaborate, and support other teams beyond those that report to them directly. Don’t assume that teams in different silos will naturally collaborate with each other, no matter how much they are committed to the goals and have the right information.
- Reinforce to your team members, and have them reinforce to their teams, that all their individual decisions need to actively and directly help move the organization toward the strategic goals you have identiﬁed. Your vision and strategy practices come into play here as well, especially the efforts you make through those practices to ensure that everyone understands your unifying direction and strategic objectives.
- In addition to communicating your vision and strategy, push as much information as possible down to all your teams in order for them to make the best possible decisions. The more they know, the better they will be able to ﬁnd the right ways to collaborate with other teams in the service of achieving the strategic goals.
For example, to help his teams communicate with each other, Welch challenged GE to become a “boundaryless organization” in which information and resources could move quickly up and down the hierarchy, across functions and business units, and between the company and its customers and suppliers. To make this happen, Welch required all his senior leaders to sponsor and participate in two-day “Work-Out” sessions where people from different parts of the organization, regardless of title or pay grade, came together to quickly solve business problems. Sessions also were held between GE and its customers and suppliers. The WorkOuts—which GE and many other companies still hold—not only produced untold millions of dollars in business beneﬁts, but also taught previously siloed teams how to work together without waiting for the boss to bring them together.
Creating your team and coordinating a network of teams are key steps for navigating the balancing act between organizational success and individual satisfaction. Talented people thrive in an environment where they can effectively and easily work with others either day to day or as needed and feel that they are making a difference. And the more these people thrive and leverage their skills, the more successful your organization will be.
Harnessing performance feedback
Another key element in bringing people on board to execute your strategy is making sure that everyone knows how they are doing, so that they can continually improve and grow. We saw this at the Ford Foundation: Walker used performance feedback to help develop the digital capabilities of existing staff as the organization’s strategy evolved. Without feedback, individuals and teams won’t get signals that tell them whether their day-to-day efforts are working or not, or how to change. This is a key way of fulﬁlling the social contract by ensuring that people understand what it takes to succeed or whether another organization might be a better ﬁt.
Giving constructive, candid, and timely feedback to subordinates is taught in just about every management curriculum. But even experienced leaders struggle with it, particularly because of the anxiety that it triggers. Looking another person in the eye and telling them how they are doing (whether good or bad) is difﬁcult, and even more so when it might affect the person’s livelihood or career. So we tend to avoid doing it, do it awkwardly, or slough it off to human resources. However, giving feedback is an even more critical s ill for leaders than managers, because leaders are not only responsible for providing feedback to their own direct reports, but also for setting the tone for feedback and learning for the organization. It’s a key part of having broader impact; as Mark Benjamin, when he was president of NCR Corporation, told us: “If I don’t set the tone properly about giving candid feedback, the problem multiplies itself exponentially. There are 33,000 people at seven levels below me, and if I don’t do it well, it could mean that there is someone on my team, who might have 4,000 people reporting to him, that doesn’t do it well. So then the bar is lowered for all of those people.”
Of course, you might not have thousands of people in your organization. But even if you and your direct reports are responsible for only a few dozen, each one needs to knows how they are doing. Just as the vision and strategy you set cascade down through your direct reports to others in your area, the way you give performance feedback also creates patterns beyond your immediate team. So not only must you give feedback to your direct reports effectively, but they must also do the same with their people.
Get through with tough feedback
For feedback to be effective, you need to think through the process and message beforehand and prepare yourself psychologically. Feedback can’t be done well on the ﬂy or in a hurried and frenzied conversation, no matter how busy you are. Sure, there will be times when it’s appropriate to give feedback in the moment in response to a particular incident, but even then you should take a deep breath to think before you speak. As a leader, your words carry extra weight, and if you are overly negative, you can crush a person’s spirit and self-conﬁdence. So keep in mind a few principles:
- The act of giving feedback is ﬁrst and foremost a business activity that’s important for the health of the organization—to make sure people are doing the right things in the right ways. As Vito Corleone said in The Godfather, “It’s not personal, it’s business.” The goal is not to make the other person feel bad, or to put them down, or to make yourself feel powerful. Rather, it’s about making the other person successful so that you can achieve your organizational goals. And if someone can’t be successful in their current role, then it’s in both of your best interests to help the person ﬁnd another role where they can succeed, either in your organization or elsewhere.
- Because feedback has a business purpose, frame the discussion as a problem-solving exercise rather than just telling someone what to do differently. Given current performance or personal behaviors, how can the person do better? What can they do? What can you do to help? What other resources could you make available? And what are the speciﬁc steps for moving forward, and over what period of time? Structure the dialogue so that it’s a two-way street where you deﬁne the problem and invite both parties to suggest solutions.
- Base the feedback discussion on data and not just subjective impressions. Look at the results the person has achieved versus their goals, get views from other people who the person works with, and refer to critical incidents or speciﬁc examples to back up your message. Feedback should not be just your opinion.
Just as with any other skill, you need to practice, practice, practice. Giving tough and constructive feedback doesn’t come easily for most leaders, so you have to ﬁnd your own voice. Try writing out what you want to say or at least how you want to start. Role-play the dialogue with a trusted colleague or human resource person. Be clear about what you want the discussion to accomplish (an improvement plan, a better understanding of what’s expected, a decision to change roles, etc.). Then assess afterward how well you did and what you could have done better.
In addition to individual discussions, one of the most powerful ways to deliver tough feedback so that an individual can hear it is with 360-degree feedback, which provides comments from multiple sources—boss, peers, subordinates, customers, and others. This assessment is particularly powerful because if common themes from a number of others don’t align with a person’s own view, those themes become more difﬁcult to dismiss or ignore. Richard Ober, CEO of the New Hampshire Charitable Foundation, described the effect: “One of our key people was a brilliant problem solver and project manager, but did not have much experience leading people, and the culture in her group was strained. We did a 360 assessment to identify her core capabilities and weaknesses. She was stunned to hear reactions of people about working with her. I took advantage of her openness to listen to start intensively coaching her to evolve from being great at doing to being great at empowering. Now she’s one of the best performers on our senior team and consistently gets very high rankings on annual employee surveys.”
There will be times when people don’t respond to individual feedback, however, and don’t develop the way you need them to. When you’ve exhausted ways of discussing with them what needs to change, you may have to take action, letting them go from your team, as we described earlier in this chapter.
Team feedback
Feedback is not just a tool for improving the performance of an individual; you also should give feedback to your team about how they are performing together, and you should encourage the team members to give feedback to each other. For example, Jim Ziolkowski, the head of a nonproﬁt called build On, brings his leadership team together at the end of every year for a four-day session where they talk about how well each person and department achieved their key performance indicators for the year. Each leader prepares a brief summary of what they did well, where they fell short, and what they need to do differently in the next year, after which all the other team members give their comments and suggestions. They also talk about how their performances affect each other and how they can support each other going forward.
Leaders should give performance feedback to entire organizations at times, particularly about key performance themes or issues. Walker’s challenge to the Ford Foundation about becoming more digitally savvy is a great example of this. Often this is the beginning of signiﬁcant transformation and improvement for your organization, which we’ll talk about in chapter 5. The point, however, is that feedback is essential not only for individual change, but for collective change as well.
Feedback throughout the organization
Giving feedback effectively to your own people models the behavior for others in your division or unit. But you also must build regular processes into the rhythm of the organization to make sure it happens regularly. Most large organizations already have a performance management system setting deﬁned times throughout the year for employee assessment. These conversations often culminate in decisions about promotions, compensation, and development needs.
As a leader within that system, you need to meet the requirements of this enterprise cadence and also put your own stamp on it. That’s the difference between your team seeing performance management as an onerous corporate process and seeing it as one that drives real business value. For example, the leader of a sales team within a large technology ﬁrm set up monthly talent talks with each of her direct reports and a quarterly talent talk with the group as a way of reinforcing the importance of keeping a focus on performance issues, both good and bad, and doing something about them. Then, when it was time to ﬁll out the yearly corporate performance management forms and participate in the associated meetings, she and her team were already well prepared.
Of course, if you are leading a startup or a nonproﬁt, or taking over an organization, you may need to construct a broader cadence yourself. Just make sure that it ﬁts your needs and encourages constructive feedback, and don’t just delegate the creation of this system to human resources. For example, Dan Springer, CEO of DocuSign, insists that each manager have a performance discussion with their people twice each year, talking about what they are trying to achieve and what they are doing for the customer, the company, and the team. To compel his managers to actually do these well, he asks them to create a brief, one-page summary of the discussion and send it directly to him. He then reads all of them and randomly sends notes back to managers with comments about the reviews, sometimes asking them to do the review again if it didn’t seem to have been truly productive.
Strategy consulting ﬁrm Boston Consulting Group (BCG) has another approach. In addition to immediate feedback on projects, BCG has a formal yearly process of written reviews for each of the 1,000-plus partners in the ﬁrm. These reviews are discussed in face-to-face meetings of the top twenty-seven senior leaders during partner performance week and are used to make decisions about bonuses, promotions, future assignments, and key development goals, which are then discussed with partners one on one. According to BCG’s president and CEO Richard Lesser, this process gives the top leaders an understanding of talent across the organization and reinforces a “one ﬁrm” culture with consistent messaging. It also helps those leaders calibrate their own contributions with the many impressive performances outside their own areas, keeping them grounded and focused on supporting the next generation.
As your department or unit gets larger or you get more responsibility and the pace of work increases, you also should make sure that your performance management system doesn’t become overly bureaucratic and begin to lose its value of driving systematic feedback and improvement. For example, Raghu Krishnamoorthy, senior vice president and chief human resource ofﬁcer at GE, notes in HBR’s “The Secret Ingredient in GE’s Talent-Review System” that GE’s leaders (up to and including the CEO) routinely spend 30 percent of their time on people issues, including having intensive debates on individual performance evaluations. To get better return from that time, GE is working toward creating digital tools to make this process more streamlined and ﬂexible so that these discussions can happen when they are needed, not just at certain times of the year. Profesional services ﬁrm Deloitte also is reinventing its performance management process and reducing the time involved by focusing more on quarterly performance snapshots than on yearly evaluations. Marcus Buckingham and Ashley Goodall describe this transformation in more detail in their HBR article “Reinventing Performance Management.”
The result of an intense, candid, and transparent feedback process during the course of the year is that staff throughout the organization, and your team speciﬁcally, know where they stand and how they have to improve. It also weeds out weak performers or those that no longer ﬁt with your team, department, or the organization. Equally important, it gives you a solid basis for assigning people to new opportunities or roles.
Fostering learning and development
Giving your direct reports feedback and creating a system for feedback throughout the organization is one way to foster the employee growth you need to meet your strategic goals. More formal learning and development is another way. By giving your direct reports and aspiring leaders resources for personal and career improvement so that they can better meet the organization’s needs, you are also giving your people the ability to adjust, grow, and thrive to meet their own goals—an important part of fulﬁlling the social contract. For example, look again at the Ford Foundation: Walker was able to help his program managers learn to understand the digital world by hiring technology fellows. Thus, he was able to keep many of these employees on board, while they equipped themselves to perform well in other future roles.
Your human resource function likely focuses on this kind of development speciﬁcally, but you have a role as a leader as well. By putting some of your own time into the talent development of your team and creating stretch opportunities for your best performers, you can drive your vision and strategy and give everyone the sense that you take your employees’ career growth seriously, which can be a major selling point in attracting even more good talent.
Put your time into top talent
Jack Welch used to say that he only had two ways of making an impact on GE: one was to allocate ﬁnancial resources differentially, and the other was to ensure that his various business units had the best possible leaders to take advantage of that ﬁnancial capital. To make that happen, Welch spent a huge amount of personal time reviewing and sharpening leadership succession plans and decisions, interacting with promising leaders, and conveying messages about leadership themes to various groups inside and outside the company.
How involved you should be in talent development depends on your personality as well as the size, scope, nature, and maturity of your organization or unit. But you do need to be personally involved to some degree; this can’t just be delegated to human resources or consultants. After all, you are in the best position to connect the vision and strategy with the talent development plan. And when you’re directly involved, you send a
message to all other managers and employees the development is a serious business endeavor and not just a nice perk to make people happy.
One way to structure your involvement is by participating in the talent and leadership planning review process like Welch. Another way is by personally participating in special events, programs, and training sessions with your team members. Often senior people feel that development sessions are just for lower-level people, and if they participate at all, it’s just a ritual appearance or speech. Joining in more intensively, however, can be a powerful opportunity to get to know your team members and future leaders, share your views about what’s important, and send a signal that learning and development is for everyone.
For example, shortly after Kenneth Frazier became the CEO of biopharmaceutical company Merck, his human resource team organized a series of development sessions for high-potential leaders (ﬁfty at a time) in conjunction with a prominent business school. Frazier met with the designers of the program to ensure that his views about what leaders needed to do to make Merck successful were incorporated. But Frazier didn’t stop there. In addition, he personally attended the two-day programs from beginning to end as a full participant, engaging in small-group and plenary discussions throughout. This gave him direct exposure to dozens of potential leaders whom he hadn’t known before and gave him a platform to share his vision for the company and what it needed to do strategically. His participation also sent a strong signal to the participants, and the thousands of people who reported to them, that Frazier was committed not only to Merck’s long-term success, but to theirs as well, which is the essence of the social contract.
Leaders don’t need to spend all their time sitting through leadership development programs. But you should take a hard look at your calendar and at how much time you are devoting to the review and development of your department’s or team’s talent. For many leaders, business, customer, and competitive pressures often squeeze out the time for direct involvement in the development of their people. If you let this happen, however, you may end up with people who won’t be able to help you reach your goals.
Stretch your high potentials
Another way that you can personally give your team members opportunities to grow is to force people into assignments and projects that will stretch their abilities beyond what they think might be possible.
Most research on talent development shows that leaders learn much more from real situations in which they are forced to get things done than they do from case studies, simulations, and training sessions. Harvard Business School professor Michael Beer and his colleagues have pointed out for years that leadership training on its own—roughly a $350 billion business (as of 2015)—has little impact on real leadership performance (for more, see their HBR article “Why Leadership Training Fails, and What to Do About It”). As a leader, you can create challenges for your direct reports, and if you are a senior leader, you can make sure that these kinds of opportunities are available to high-potential people throughout the organization.
You can create these kinds of experiences for your team members by:
- Giving your direct reports tougher and broader goals. For example, McKinsey Global managing partner Dominic Barton describes what happened when he was tossed into the deep water early in his professional life:
  The key to my career was when I was asked to head up the McKinsey ofﬁce in Korea. We had eighty people but weren’t considered to be a prominent ﬁrm in Korea and didn’t really have a way to grow. The orthodox wisdom, I was told by my predecessor, was to keep a low proﬁle, not be in the media, and not talk to newspapers. But if we were so quiet, how would any Korean companies know about us? So I took a risk and started to write a short newspaper column every week about business and management issues. It was published in Korean, so I knew that nobody at McKinsey outside of Korea would read it and I couldn’t get caught. Eventually, these columns helped me get to know the ﬁfty people who really matter in Korea, build relationships with them, and grow our practice. In essence, I had a small playground to work in and try new stuff.
 
- Asking your people to work together to achieve something. For example, the president of a large academic medical center asked his top twenty leaders to jointly address the changing healthcare landscape and ﬁnd ways to put the institution on more solid ﬁnancial footing. These leaders, who ran various clinical departments, research areas, and operational functions, were all experts in their ﬁelds, but had little experience leading strategic change, nor had they developed their skills at working across disciplines. They tended to be protective of their own areas and budgets. By taking on this joint assignment, however, the leaders were forced to take an institutional perspective and think about trade-offs between areas. They brought in experts on health-care trends to educate them on the external environment and learned how to do a SWOT-style analysis on their own organization. Over the course of several months, they identiﬁed a number of strategic initiatives and ﬁnancial shifts and took responsibility for getting them organized and carried out. In addition to the institutional results, the effort helped the leaders develop new skills and perspectives. One eventually became the interim president, and another became the chief operating ofﬁcer—roles that they would never have been able to handle without this experience.
- Moving people into stretch assignments. You and your HR partner can set this up in a number of ways, such as through project-based training or special projects. In project-based training, high-potential leaders from different areas are given a speciﬁc project to achieve over a twoto three-month period (while continuing their regular jobs) and learn skills needed to accomplish the project through focused workshops, webinars, or work with a leadership coach. Siemens, for example, used this approach for many years to not only accomplish substantial results (such as introducing products into new countries), but also to develop hundreds of next-generation leaders. And if your organization doesn’t offer training like this, you can take the initiative by giving your people special projects on your own and support their learning with online, university-based, or consulting inputs. For example, the head of a marketing team challenged one of her high potentials to organize a new recruiting process for the team and sent him to a university program on human capital to get some fresh perspectives.
- Creating job rotations. Another approach is to rotate your people through different parts of the company so that they have hands-on experience with a variety of business challenges, cultures, and geographies. International Paper, for example, moves its highpotential leaders across units and geographies to give them a broader perspective on the company and to see how they perform under different conditions. If your company doesn’t do this routinely, you can work with colleagues to trade good people or just champion some of your people for open positions. Some leaders hesitate to do this because they fear losing good people from their team, but if you don’t actively help them ﬁnd new opportunities, the best people will do it on their own, and you might lose them from the organization completely. The other advantage of actively helping your people move is that you will then have a network of former team members throughout the organization who can collaborate with you and support you in the future.
While all these approaches to development sound straightforward and sensible, many leaders still hesitate to act on them. After all, it takes work, time, and money to develop people, and if you do a really good job, the person might still go to another team or another company anyway where they can get more money or responsibility. Great people will always have other opportunities. So why should we make the investment and watch someone else reap the returns?
Unfortunately, there is no easy answer to this question. Great leaders, however, understand that it is ultimately less expensive and far more effective to develop their own talent than to constantly bring in outsiders who will need to go through a learning curve and who might not work out in the end. Internal people usually have a far greater chance of success and become productive much more quickly. So in the long run, developing talent will pay off many times over, both in productivity and in reinforcing the social contract of your organization.
Sharing your incentives philosophy
Not all people are alike. They have different motivations for coming to work and different long-term career aspirations. At the same time, the actual work that they do is not always comparable. So how do you reward everyone for their performance in a way that they feel is fair and equitable, and that attracts, retains, and develops the kind of talent you need—and doesn’t break the bank? Questions of incentives always get to the heart of the social contract: your compensation framework must address all these competing concerns.
Many leaders simply try to avoid these questions by creating or perpetuating undifferentiated compensation systems (“just give everyone a 5 percent raise”), by staying away from career discussions with their people, or by just turning compensation over to human resources. And while that may ease their discomfort, it rarely creates high-performing organizations, because it means that good people often end up going elsewhere.
Instead, your role as a leader is to articulate a philosophy of incentives clearly so that people know what it takes to be successful—whoever they are and whatever their goals.
Make your incentive philosophy explicit
Your job as a leader is not to get into the business of designing compensation and beneﬁts plans. There are hundreds of expert consultants and ﬁrms that can do this work for you, along with your own human resource team, whether you’re a startup or a multibillion-dollar organization. But in order for these experts to put together a plan that will help you achieve business results and make people feel good about being part of your team, you do need to provide some clear direction for how to decide on salaries and bonuses, award promotions, and confer other beneﬁts. That is what we call a “philosophy of incentives.”
Even if you are not in a position to drive an incentives approach for the whole organization, by sketching out a philosophy of incentives for your department or unit (based on the organizational rewards system), you’ll make your people aware of what behaviors and outcomes will be rewarded and recognized, and what it will take to advance in their careers, and, conversely, what behaviors or results will have adverse implications for their careers. Without that clarity, employees and managers will make their own decisions about what’s best to do, and it might not actually be what you want or intend.
Steve Kerr, an expert on reward systems and the ﬁrst chief learning ofﬁcer for GE and then Goldman Sachs, in the HBR article “The Best-Laid Incentive Plans,” describes “the folly of rewarding A while hoping for B.”The classic case of this is when a leader rewards and promotes people based on achieving individual goals, while assuming (or hoping) that these people will work together for the greater good of the team. But if their individual goals conﬂict with each other in some way, it’s likely that they will compete with each other rather than collaborate, not because they are ornery, but because most people will rationally do what’s in their own best interest ﬁrst.
By making your incentives philosophy explicit, you send a clear message to your people about what you expect of them. For example, Andrew Géczy, the CEO of Terra Firma, a private equity ﬁrm in Europe, and a former executive at Lloyds and ANZ banks, explained to us that part of his incentives philosophy is that people’s behaviors (and not just their performance results) are a key factor for compensation and promotion. He uses a two-dimensional grid for performance assessment with behaviors on one axis and results on the other. By making this clear to his organization, he prevents his managers from using tactics to get results in the short term that could harm the organization in the longer run.
Questions to ask
As you articulate your incentives philosophy, here are a few questions that you should address:
- To what extent are you committed to making sure that your team truly functions as a meritocracy, where individual achievement is rewarded versus just tenure, loyalty, or personal relationships? (Some leaders talk about results being paramount, but then reward people differently.) 
- Is tenure rewarded at all (and if so, how)?
- What’s the balance between individual achievement and collective achievement? In other words, should your team members be rewarded if they hit their individual goals, but the team misses its targets? Or should there be a portion of individual rewards that is based on the collective results—and that perhaps will differ for senior versus junior people? What about vice versa—what happens if the team or organization does well but individuals miss? Should they share in the rewards anyway? What is the weight on the individual versus organizational success?
- What behaviors are critical for success on your team? How seriously will you assess and compare these with the achievement of goals? What happens if someone does a fantastic job of reaching their business targets, but falls short in the behavioral sphere? Will you follow Jack Welch’s lead and ask that person to leave despite the good results? Will you give them a second chance?
- What kinds of nonmonetary rewards can you provide as recognition for work well done? In addition to personal praise, to what extent can you use your communications channels to recognize people and make them heroes? Are there opportunities for managers and teams to present their achievements to others? Should you reward exceptional contributors through dinners, trips, or outings? What other ways can you make your team and top performers feel truly appreciated?
Obviously, every leader will answer these questions differently, and some will be applicable for the entire organization while others will apply at certain levels. Senior leaders, of course, have more inﬂuence over the entire incentives approach. But even if you are a team leader, you need to know how your organization thinks about these questions so that you can communicate them to your people. You also need to think about whether you can have some local control over some of the incentives. For example, there might be some companywide behaviors that are encouraged and rewarded, but you may have some additional behaviors that you want your team to follow. Similarly, there might be nonﬁnancial incentives that all leaders in the organization use, but there may be others that you develop yourself for your team (e.g., dinners with people who make special contributions).
Once you are clear about the answers to these questions (whether you are making the decisions yourself or more senior leaders are giving them to you), you need to communicate them to your team. Sometimes these are well understood or may be part of an employee handbook and on-boarding orientation. Usually, however, the incentives philosophy is somewhat opaque, with people making assumptions about what it takes to be rewarded or to get ahead. And in the absence of common understanding, people will be surprised, disappointed, or hurt when they receive their compensation decisions or talk with you about their career prospects. On the other hand, if you do make the basis for incentives as clear as possible, your people will have a pretty good idea ahead of time what to expect and will know what they need to do in order to do better.
In short, your job as a leader is to make the principles of rewards and incentives as clear as possible. Talk to your team as a group about the philosophy and what it means. Then talk to each person individually, long before compensation or reward decisions are made or announced, about how the philosophy applies to them. Is there a behavior that they need to work on? Do they need to temper their expectations for a raise because the overall company is not doing so well? Do they need to gain some other kind of experience in order to advance to a higher level?
The key point is that everyone in the organization needs to know the principles and how they apply to them. Even more importantly, once these principles are articulated, they need to be followed. If you and other leaders are seen as talking a good game, but not following through, it will damage your credibility and diminish people’s commitment to your organization.
Shaping a culture for executing your strategy
Culture is one of those words that is used all of the time, but its meaning is not always clear. The dictionary deﬁnition is that an organization’s culture is the sum of attitudes, beliefs, customs, and behaviors that distinguish one group from another. That culture develops over time as groups of people work together and create repeated patterns and habits. Eventually these patterns become informal rules or norms that most people in the group adhere to, and to which new members have to adapt. In this way, organizational culture has intense power to promote certain behaviors and actions.
Culture also is a key factor in people’s decisions about whether to be a party to the social contract of your team—that is, whether your unit will be a place where they can meet their personal needs. And if the culture turns out not to be a good ﬁt with their expectations or abilities, people might opt out.
Managing your team’s culture is thus a powerful way to determine how effectively your people execute on your vision and translate your strategy into action. If your new vision or strategy is generally in accord with the culture, then change can happen quickly. But if the current culture is at odds with the kind of strategic change you are proposing, it can be a true roadblock. That’s why many CEOs are fond of saying that “culture trumps strategy,” a truism that Jon Katzenbach and his coauthors explain in their HBR article “Cultural Change That Sticks.”
The main problem with managing culture, however, is that it’s invisible, implicit, and hard to describe. If you ask ten people in your company or team to portray your culture, you’ll probably get ten different answers because everyone sees it from their own perspective. In addition, every organization has subcultures, perhaps in geographies (how things are done in a particular ofﬁce) or functions (R&D works differently than ﬁnance), or in units that were bolted on through acquisitions (but retained their old cultures).
Perhaps you can’t change your team’s or organization’s culture completely or quickly, but you can try to get some key aspects of culture to work for you instead of against you. To do so:
- First, make your cultural goals explicit to your direct reports and their people.
- Then, use the elements already described in this chapter to move people toward those goals.
Deﬁne your cultural goals
It’s not up to us to say what your team’s culture should be or how you should try to shape it. That’s a decision that you and your team should make, based on your vision and the strategy that you are trying to execute. Given the increasing pace of competitive and technological innovation, however, many organizations are trying to create cultures that are speciﬁcally more agile, open to change, and quick to align themselves with new ideas. If that’s the case for you, then your cultural goals should reﬂect these shifts and/or others that are important.
To make your cultural goals explicit, work with your direct reports. First, discuss the key cultural characteristics that currently exist in your organization or group. You can use an assessment like the one in ﬁgure 3-1, which deﬁnes some basic areas of organizational culture, to prompt your discussion. You may want to add some other areas that pertain speciﬁcally to the strategy you are pursuing, such as digital savvy (as in the Ford Foundation example) or openness to partnerships.
Next, consider how you might need your team’s culture to be different in order to support and drive your particular strategic goals. Where are the biggest score gaps? As you work, continue to iterate this dialogue with other groups and ask your direct reports to hold similar sessions with their teams. Since culture is the accumulation of behaviors across an organization, you can’t just dictate it from the top down. You also have to engage people at other levels so that they buy into and help shape the cultural shifts and make them come alive.
For example, the head of a small factory within a large corporation became frustrated when he learned that most of the plant’s productivityimprovement projects, all of which his team had ratiﬁed, were delayed. As he dug into the situation, he realized that the problem was not lack of skills, know-how, or resources, but an inability of his direct reports to make decisions (at all stages of the projects) without him. Since he was too busy to attend every project meeting, many decisions were simply not made. In talking with his team about this pattern, he realized that this was a cultural issue: his team members were hesitant to take risks, and he had not truly empowered them to do so, which made him the decision-making bottleneck. As this pattern became clear, the plant manager began to pull himself out of each decision, and as issues came up, he repeatedly told his direct reports to use their best judgment and do what they thought best. At ﬁrst, his people hesitated (or didn’t believe him) and kept going back to ask him what to do. But over the course of several months, as he repeatedly refused to make the decisions for them and kept pushing them to do it themselves, the culture started to change. And as team members made their own decisions and the culture began to shift, delivery times on the projects dramatically improved.
Identifying cultural shifts or priorities is important at all levels of the organization. At GE in the 1990s, Jack Welch saw that the company was highly bureaucratic, slow moving, hierarchical, complex, and overly analytical. He and his leadership team emphasized “speed, simplicity, and selfconﬁdence” as three cultural characteristics that he wanted to encourage, and that they saw as critical for GE’s success in the twenty-ﬁrst century.
When Ken Frazier became the CEO of Merck, he did something similar. At the time, Merck was in the ﬁnal stages of integrating its purchase of Schering-Plough Pharmaceuticals, and the combination of the two companies had created a very large but overly complex and slow-to-decide enterprise. To counter this, Frazier set cultural goals focused on the principles of “prioritize” (focus on what’s important), “align” (collaborate with others to get these important things done), and “simplify” (ﬁnd the most direct and least complex ways of doing them).

Shift the culture
Naturally, it’s not enough to just state some desired cultural shifts. You also have to take action to move your organization toward them. While there are powerful symbolic acts you can perform to model the culture (see the box “Symbolic actions to model cultural behaviors”), the other elements of managing people we describe in this chapter also constitute deeper ways to set a culture shift in motion.
Build your leadership team
If you have some clear cultural shifts in mind, then you can look for people who tend to work in those ways, just as Darren Walker actively recruited new program managers with more digital savvy and who could work more effectively in a digital world. If someone on your team does not exemplify your cultural goals, you may need to let them go, as Welch did with the high-performing business leader who was out of step with Welch’s goals for the culture. This incident sent reverberations throughout GE that cultural behaviors mattered and would be factored into promotions, rewards, and advancement. Years later, many people still feel that that moment was the turning point for changing GE’s culture.
As you manage how all your teams work together, ask them to think a few minutes about their own cultures and how they are working, and what they can do differently going forward to move toward the cultural goals you have set.
Symbolic actions to model cultural behaviors
As a leader, you can have an outsized inﬂuence on your organization’s culture by modeling the behaviors that you want to encourage. A study by Angelo Kinicki and Chad Hartnell (described in Alison Beard’s article “CEOs Shouldn’t Try to Embody Their Firms’ Culture”) found that CEOs in the best-performing organizations actually behave diﬀerently from the prevailing culture because their job is to bring new ways of working to the table. They note, “Leadership styles are contagious. So, if a CEO [who wants to drive more discipline around results] . . . does strategy and implementation reviews with his top team every other week for a year, it will have a trickle-down eﬀect and eventually change the culture of the whole enterprise.”
Leaders also can inﬂuence organizational culture through small, subtle, and even symbo ic actions. Jack Welch used to send personal, handwritten notecards to employees as a way of reinforcing and recognizing particular behaviors that he wanted to encourage. Robert Galvin, former CEO of Motorola, often would have his lunch in the employee cafeteria to signal that executives were accessible and wanted to listen. The new president of a large ﬁnancial ﬁrm that worked with prominently
displayed a “no whining” sign in her oﬃce to reinforce her emphasis on solving problems and not just complaining about them—a message that quickly circulated through the ranks. Other executives we’ve seen have used their personal involvement in nonproﬁt causes as a way of encouraging their people to give back.
One reality of being a leader is that people infer messages and signals from your behavior, whether you intend to convey these or not. Anne Mulcahy of Xerox told us that one of the toughest things about being a CEO is that she had to be “always on,” and even things she said or ways she acted in unguarded moments could be interpreted as important. The downside is that the bad behavior of a leader (insensitivity, abuse, lack of accountability) can create a license for everyone else to act that way, which can lead to an extremely dysfunctional culture. The upside, however, is that the impact of your positive behaviors can multiply many times over.
Harness performance feedback
Performance feedback is a more obvious way of shifting culture-related behavior. To use it this way, however, you need to be very clear in your feedback about the desired cultural behaviors and the gaps that might exist, and you need to do this without pulling punches. In most organizations that have shifted their cultures, this kind of brutal honesty is critical. You should also include questions about a person’s cultural ﬁt in their 360-degree evaluations.
 
Foster career development
While you create opportunities for people to grow and develop, and advance in their careers, you can simultaneously help them understand, internalize, and act on the cultural goals that will enable your strategy. For example, in the high-potential leadership development sessions at Merck, Ken Frazier not only talked about his vision and strategy for the company, but also about how having a culture of prioritize, align, and simplify would help make it happen. During the sessions, Frazier and the faculty (including other Merck executives) also facilitated speciﬁc discussions about how these leaders could apply the cultural principles to their day-to-day work, and each made speciﬁc commitments to do so. You can also make job rotations and stretch assignments with the explicit expectation that these will be opportunities for the leader to learn new behaviors, not just get exposed to a different business or geography.
Oﬀer incentives
Positive reinforcement of cultural behaviors is powerful. When organizational members see that the people who are rewarded, promoted, and recognized are those who exhibit the desired cultural behaviors, it provides a strong incentive to also act in those ways. You also can reinforce the desired behaviors by selecting people for key assignments who already have those behaviors, or who have the potential to do so.
Putting this all together, of course, takes a lot of hard work and isn’t accomplished overnight. Over the long term, however, building a culture that helps you advance your strategic goals, and that people feel good about, can have an enormous impact on your organization and can reinforce the social contract. It also can be incredibly rewarding for you as a leader. When reﬂecting on his tenure as dean of Haas Business School at the University of California, Berkeley, Richard Lyons told us that aligning the school with a concise set of cultural principles was perhaps the most signiﬁcant thing he had achieved because it had become such a key factor in attracting students and faculty to the school. Shaping the culture also shaped his legacy: “It has put heart and soul into the institution that will outlive me.”
The practices we’ve described throughout this chapter are not sequential steps, nor one-off activities. Instead, in order to create a high achievement and high-morale organization, you need to continually practice these elements, determining the right way to approach them as your organization continues to change. Bringing people on board to support your vision and strategy requires constantly assessing and adjusting these different elements over time.
But done well, you can attract talent for years to come. Mastering the steps we’ve described and creating a culture that blends both organizational and personal success is hard work, and many of the associated skills for doing this may not come naturally. Taking some of these actions may also require uncomfortable discussions, such as when you need to be tough about performance feedback or promotions or rewards. Getting the right balance between organizational and personal success may not win you any
popularity contests. But in the long run, it will be one of the keys to unlocking your own leadership potential and generating the signiﬁcant impact that makes a difference for your organization.
But to achieve that impact, you need to enable this motivated team and staff to generate results. In chapter 4, we’ll talk about how to make that happen.
 Questions to Consider
Your team. What skills and capabilities do you need within your team of direct reports? Does the team meet your expectations, or do you need to make some changes?
 ■ Fostering teamwor . Are you satisﬁed with how well you and your direct reports function as a team? Do you have shared goals, agreed-on ways of working, and a common mindset? Do your team members help each other to be successful, and do they foster a “team of teams” approach that prevents silos from getting in the way of doing good work? Do they work to promote and extend the right kind of values and performance behaviors throughout the organization?
 ■ Performance feedback. How faithfully do you give brutally honest but constructive feedback to your team members? How well do the members of your team give candid performance feedback to their direct reports?
 ■ Developing talent. Are you spending enough time on developing the skills and capabilities of your team members? What do they aspire to achieve in their careers? How does each of them need to develop in order to be successful, and how you can stretch them to do that?
 ■ Incentives. Have you made it clear to your team members what it takes to be rewarded and recognized, both individually and collectively?
 ■ Culture. What cultural characteristics do you want your team to exhibit?How well are you modeling this culture with your own behavior?
